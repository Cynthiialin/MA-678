We were cared for very warmly in this house (great talks at the porch,  even having dinner with Hettie and her husband once,  tipps for visiting L.A. and for having breakfast nearby in a lovely little café). We felt at home immediately.  Plus it was very clean which was great because my baby is crawling around everywhere.  It ist situated in a nice neighborhood and  L.A. downtown is easy to reach. All in all I can recommend this room wholeheartedly to everyone who looks for a nice and quiet place in the middle of L.A. that feels like home."

His place is beautiful and clean, and in such a nice and safe neighborhood! The room smelled like essential oils and was so relaxing to come home to after a long tiring day. Perfect place to stay even if you’re travelling closer to LA; drive isn’t too bad and a relaxing getaway for a good great value! 5/5 stars!!"

We loved the view from the hilltop. The trailer was clean & perfectly equipped with anything you could need! You should expect that there is no enough space for your baggages but it was ok if you just store it under the bed & take out your important things when needed (; 
I liked the fresh lemon ice cream I found in the freezer. Thank you Chris & Efren"

The living room was very cozy and relaxing to chill out and watch TV. I was only there for one night so didn’t have a chance to cook. The patio offers a wonderful view on Hollywood Blvd. The location is great, only a block away from the heart of Hollywood but far enough away that it wasn’t noisy at night. I was provided a parking space that was gated which made coming and going very simple! There were also lots of activities and food places around. Adel communicated very professionally and promptly which made everything easy. I had a wonderful stay!"

Lo Studio è perfettamente ubicato nel cuore di Hollywood, e permette di raggiungere facilmente alcuni dei punti d`interesse della zona. Fotini ci ha lasciato anche il permesso per parcheggiare direttamente fuori dalla casa, e quindi non abbiamo dovuto sborsare un dollaro. Per quanto riguarda la casa, è come la vedete in foto. Arredata di tutto punto, pulita e accogliente. Siamo rimasti veramente soddisfatti, e ci siamo ripromessi di tornarci il prima possibile. Alloggio veramente consigliato, grazie Fotini!"

In addition to being stylish, clean, and convenient, the hosts were super responsive to questions and anticipated our every request—like offering another comforter when it got surprisingly cold.

It took only 15 min to Universal Studios and 30 min to Santa Monica. 60 min to Anaheim and Disneyland. People from Global are really nice and answer promptly to any inquiry. They even send someone to attend whenever you have an issue. The house has basic utensils, towels, linens, toilet paper, soap and shampoo."

We had some interesting conversations about different themes. Carrie has a very cute dog Fiona, as soon as she knows you she let you pet her. :-) The room is big enough and the bed is really comfortable. You also have your own bathroom. In about 3 minutes of walk you'll find a cute coffee place and the best smoothies (glowingjuices). For me it was the perfect place to stay for my time in LA and I can really recommend Carrie and her house. Thank you very much Carrie and hope to see you again soon :-)"

She also stood outside to make sure I see her when I was arriving.  She gave me a good walk through and I had her number if any issues were to arise.  I had to cancel two nights from the booking and she was so sweet and helped me with every step since it was my first time booking with AirBNB. Her neighbors were quiet and I barely saw them--Parking accommodated to economy cars but there were plenty on the streets!"

Peep holes in the bathroom , 
Super creepy vibe . scummy - I had to leave ,and rented a motel room for less then what these people charged me for .

Can’ NOT be accurate ...unless of course you want a private spot to do illicit  activity at ,. 
Don’t  be fooled like I was ..$130 bucks ?  ITS A  CREEPY DUMP!!!Creeped me out so much while undressing -I left within 20 minutes ."

I found Shinrin Yoku LA and I booked my reservation without knowing what exactly to expect. From start to finish it was a very engaging yet beautifully relaxing experience that let me feel the world using all of my faculties. I bonded with my fellows in my group for the day, and I reestablished a crucial bond that the forest and I have, which I often forget about. Shinrin Yoku makes it an easy and wonderful process to engage in. Thanks, again Ben and everyone else I met along the way of our little journey. <3"

The surrounding neighborhood is safe and quiet, allowing my friend and I peace of mind when we got back from a day out, which made our trip even better.

Josianne is a remarkable host who has gone to great lengths to make sure her guests have everything they may need during their stay. She is ready and willing to give recommendations, and you can tell she truly loves L.A. The guest house is gorgeous, and everything was spotless. The bed and linens are so cozy; we felt right at home. Best of all, the neighborhood is incredibly peaceful and quiet --  but near so many good restaurants. We were able to walk to several during our stay. From check-in to check-out, our experience was perfect. We will definitely be back the next time we travel to Los Angeles."

It is conveniently located in between the coastal area and the city area of LA, even if the surroundings of the flat, walking, offer very little access to restaurants or shops.

I just needed a place to sleep for a couple of night and be close to UCLA my place of work.  First night I could not  sleep for it was a hot night in LA, their rules said no A/C overnight but I didn't think that a really hot summer night in LA meant no A/C at all. I let Jeff know my concerns and he tried to accommodate me for the second night. Other than the no A/C issue I recommend their place for it its in a nice secure location, the bed it's incredibly comfortable and the place is clean. He had a parking spot for me but street parking was very convenient, I found parking just outside the apartment for my stay.

Also the handover of the key, free internet information etc. were well organised and available. The neighbourhood is beautiful and quite.

From the beginning I should of known. Host had automatic messages that were sent right after booking and then didn’t respond until the day of my booking. I had to download an app to retrieve the keys which were at a location 15 min from the Airbnb. He sent a list of rules and asked for a response, but if you didn’t send back “I understand all rules and policies” word for word you were locked out of the keys. Which was our case. He offers absolutely 0 accommodations. 

Upon arrival at the apartment there were 0 cooking supplies. And empty water tank. 2 sets of utensils, 2 cups, 2 plates, no bowls. The fridge was leaking upon our arrival which we had to fix on our own. Pool was advertised but was under construction. 

Host was rude. Bed was extremely uncomfortable with a thin mattress. Dropping off keys was a mission and a half. Not worth the price and headache."

It was our first time traveling out west and we weren’t quite sure what to expect with our stay. Let me just start by saying his place made our trip amazing! It was our own little quiet piece of paradise. Each day we explored the LA area with all the hustle and bustle but just knowing we had his tranquil place to retreat to made it heavenly. The location was close to everything and his tips were great too. Both the inside decor and outside areas were so serene with lots of artistic touches. All the little extra amenities didn’t go unnoticed either like the waters, snacks, toiletries, extra towels and sheets. His response time was also great. We will definitely be back!

"651574",12364198,161072213,"2017-06-16",48730419,"Jennifer","One thing I have to say about Dean is that he is INCREDIBLY welcoming. He does not mind having or creating conversation with you about anything; whether it be about the artwork in his home, his past endeavors as a photographer, or simply what there is to do around town. We rarely crossed paths due to my busy schedule during the week, but he still made sure to greet my boyfriend and I when we did see each other. The room is quite nice, with a fan and lighting control remote, you can turn the lights off without even getting off the bed. The TV only has  Netflix, but it was fine with us since our busy schedule rarely allowed us to even check out what was in the queue. The bathroom was clean and tidy. It has a bathtub and shower separated. Dean has a separate drawer for his guests to use, which I thought was very considerate, so that guests don't have to run back and forth to the room and bathroom. 

Overall, the stay was fantastic. Dean was the first AirBNB place I stayed at on my own and I was not disappointed at all. Actually, he exceeded my expectations. I definitely recommend him if you're ever visiting California and need an affordable AND appealing place to stay. Thanks for everything, again! "

Besides the fully functional kitchen, the place is equipped with the amenities of a washer/dryer in the apartment itself, which saves me trips to the laundry. (But of course I plan and limit my laundry days so I wouldn’t over use water/electric/detergent). The location is ideal because almost everything is walking distance for me. The Hollywood Walk of Fame is literally 5 minutes away and 15 minutes walking distance to Runyon Canyon Park. There are plenty of places nearby to explore for food / shopping and is very Uber-ride convenient. Overall, I really enjoyed my stay. Thank you Andrz! Highly recommended!"

When we reported it to Airbnb, the host became hostile and harassed us until we left.  Yet, somehow he is still allowed to continue to rent this place?  (Hidden by Airbnb) how to remove black mold - it is not remedied quickly.  Also, do you want to stay with a host who yells and screams when a problem is addressed?  We were kicked out with no place to go.  My sister had just had surgery and I was in town to help her recover.  We did not need the stress.  George is not his name and he is violent."

The space is as private as you want it to be, but Benjamin and Monica are friendly if you want to talk or reach out. Good vibes all around. Parking was easy and free.

He was there to greet us on arrival and showed us around. The description is very accurate. This is a cozy, lovely, private little place in a beautiful garden. The place is very clean and well kept and there's a handy little kitchen. Area is quiet and we slept very well 

There's about 15 minutes walk to the metro and parking seems to be available. We did not have a car and it wasn't needed. The neighbourhood seemed safe even nighttime, there was a community feeling. There are Korean and Latin American shops close by and a Vons about 30 mins walk away. 

Also the Internet was good.

I would totally recommend this place and will try to stay here again if I return to the area.

The bed in the room was just okay, but the price of this place is low compared to the others.

The room is in an independent house and it is one among the three rooms that share a single bathroom. If there are other occupants in the room, the shared bathroom might be an issue. The bathroom was very neat and has all the amenities."

Good to stay if you are doing activities or attending an event in downtown. If you are a tourist, you would be about 35-45 mins from Hollywood, Beverly Hills Santa Monica, Disney and Universal. Parking is included and secure but please note that your commute around Los Angeles can be bit hectic based on traffic if you stay here. 

There is a gym downstairs which is good but the pool is small (more like an over-sized tub so keep your expectations on leash). There is a small kitchen and laundry which is good. The person who helps you check-in is nice and you can reach out to him for quick response if there are any issues.

There is no exotic view from the balcony as shared by some reviewers so don't expect that - you can only see other apartments and an alley from the balcony.  However, if you walk out, you can possibility see the best of LA downtown in person.  If you stay here - don't miss out on visiting Staples Center, LA Live, OUE Skyspace, Original Pantry Cafe and the Grammy Museum."

Die Küche ist voll ausgestattet und man kann seine Wäsche waschen (großer Pluspunkt, wenn man oft am Strand joggen geht oder im hauseigenen Fitnessstudio trainiert).

The interior is everything you expect from a California apartment, nicely decorated, huge bed, nice bathroom, perfect neighbors, relatively quiet neighborhood (considering you’re also minutes away from a kindergarten, which we never heard.

To move around, you are close to almost all bus lines either going to Santa Monica or even LA. Car rental place is pretty close if that’s what you’re going for but pretty much can still walk everywhere.

We were in town for a friends wedding at the Fairmont 3 blocks away, and we wanted to do something out of the ordinary, as well as less expensive than the Fairmont ($300/n).
We were sent the access code to enter the building via email and our apt. door was left unlocked.
Arrival went smooth, the location was great!  Litterally across from the beach-which has its positive and negatives.
We entered the building and our door was left unlocked.  The apt. we stayed was-from what i remember- apt 203, a corner apt.
The room was very clean, but not what you would expect if you stayed at a nice hotel.
Our first night was pretty bad.  The noise from the street outside was almost unbearable, and the bus stop is litterally outside the window.  Also, Santa Monica has street crossing signs that TALK, no matter what time of night... which you can hear allllll night long.

After the first night, we knew this wasn't going to work for us.  We contact Silvio and he was very accomodating.  He offered us 2 other options, and we chose a room on the 3rd floor, which was much quieter.
Unfortunately, the kitchen was infested with termites.  

I would recommend staying in a hotel, even if it's a few blocks from the beach and a little more $.

Pros:
Location
Cost
Silvio was accomodating

Cons:
noise

The effort put in to make the unit a vacation dream is incredible. Coffee and creamer.  Veggie platter. Fairy lights. Towels galore. Washer and dryer. Ur own patio. Cable. Full kitchen. Full size fridge.  Beach chairs. Umbrella. Bikes. There is to much to mention.

Thomasina was warm, welcoming and so sweet. We had an amazing time. 

My only suggestion would be to take advantage of the car parking space that is offered if u r staying over a holiday period or on a Friday/Saturday night.  Take it!!!"

We were in town for business. The place is impeccably clean, and you can tell Leslie takes very good care of the apartment. It's a 10-minute walk to the beach and also within walking distance to Santa Monica shops and restaurants; and the famous stairways to exercise are literally a few meters away! No problem finding a parking spot - in fact, we parked our car right in front of the apartment almost every day. WiFi works very well. The sink in the bathroom is a little tiny, but the bathroom is comfortable, the shower is big and has good water pressure. Leslie has a thorough list of suggestions for restaurants and things to do. She is very quick in responding and completely respects your privacy.  And we can't wait to go back!

Clean in some parts however kitchen countertop, dishes and utensils needed thorough washing. There were old fruits in the fridge left by previous guests. I mention this given relatively expensive cleaning fee charged by this place. The home was very hot throughout our stay. So hot that we had to stay out during day time and come back at late night just to wash up and sleep. Keep in mind that hot weather impacted our stay and this review. Reading other reviews, it seems like we had an unusual experience. If you choose to stay here - hope it isn't during summer and certain not during a heatwave. - When we first entered the place, we were overwhelmed by strong odor - like the one you would encounter in unventilated hot attic. The smell remained very strong throughout our stay. It was hot during our stay and thoroughly cooked the place. - We asked W.C for some relief from the hot temperature (more fans??) - but only response we got was that cooler weather was on the way (it didn't come). - Many loose door handles. My husband was trapped in the washroom for several minutes until rescued. After that, we never fully closed any doors. We did let W.C know - and he sent a handyman to tighten the washroom door knob when we were out. However, all the doors had wobbly knobs (including the front door) ready to come loose at any moment. - The place didn't have enough air-conditioning. No air-conditioning on the first floor (living room and kitchen) which may the floor unlivable. The second floor bedrooms each had an air conditioner but they were inadequately small in capacity. Making them worse was the noise - compressors running in the room. If we weren't so dead tired, there was no way we could have gotten any sleep. - And the place had very poor wiring. Electricity went out two times during our 4 nights of stay. The first outage was caused by running two small air conditioners and hair dryer on the second floor. My husband was able to locate the fuse box and restore the power with W.C's direction over the phone. On the second outage, W.C had to come to restore the electricity. W.C was quick to respond - which we were grateful. - After the second outage, my husband asked W.C why the home's wiring hadn't been refurbished. W.C's response was ""hot weather lasts only few weeks a year"" so it wasn't economical to invest in new wiring. Needless to say, that response didn't make us feel safe. Old home + inadequate wiring = safety concern. - Lastly, the neighborhood was noisy. We tried to have the windows open to catch some breeze as suggested by W.C's welcome email. On the days we were there - 1) too hot for breeze; 2) lots of noise from the street -..."

 Close enough to the heart of Silver Lake to have easy access to cafes, food, etc. but tucked away in a residential area enough to feel like you're living there.

"89271",792619,34977354,"2015-06-14",7472639,"Frédéric","While our overall stay was nice, there were a few things that we had to make note of. Chrissi was very nice and let us come early to the apartment. She made arrangements for us around noon so we  could drop off our stuff and go out. When we arrived at the place, there were two things that really stood out: the place looks much better in pictures than in real life and the studio is not in the building but in the back, attached to a separate garage (ground level). It was a little disappointing. Still, there was some privacy with a little fence surrounding the entrance. Once we arrived, we dropped off our bags and left. We didn’t get a tour of the place which later caused some problems (we couldn’t find any cutlery until we messaged Chrissi the next morning) but that is a very minor issue (it’s down below the sink cabinets in a drawer). Nevertheless, the place was super clean, the bathroom looked new and very nice, and the bed was quite comfortable. At night, the place was very quiet and the air conditioner worked very well. The only other issue we had was with the pull down curtains that didn’t completely close There were sometimes people coming in through the private entrance and passing by the window near the bed, and that wasn’t very comforting.

Lots of street parking, clean studio, and a very nice host. The only downsides are that the pictures look better than the actual place and that it is attached to the garage. Still, for the price and walking distance to cool things in Los Feliz, it is definitely a decent place to stay."

My family loved our stay at this newly renovated space which was exceptionally clean, had a cool beach vibe, beautiful views of Los Angeles,  and mere steps away from restaurants, parks,  and ,of course, the marina. There are also free shuttles  and water taxis that  provide fun ways to explore both Marina del Rey and Venice Beach.  The complex itself is meticulously  maintained and we found the neighbors to be very friendly and welcoming. The kids (ages 11 and 13) enjoyed swimming in the family pool everyday  and there was even a small dog park on site for our four legged companion.  Erik's hospitality and attention to detail was beyond reproach. We were pleasantly surprised to find a stocked pantry and storage closets filled with just about anything we could have possibly forgotten to pack! His chill vibe made us feel instantly welcomed and he remained easy to reach during our entire stay.  In the simplest terms: Gracious host, beautiful home, wonderful time. "

To be honest it felt like the minimum experience is offered instead of the maximum. Bedlinnen and towels were clean but the windows were really dirty and curtains had stains in them for example. Also a couple of ants were on the floor and bed when we got there.  I found the repelant in the cupboard which helped for the rest of our stay. You cant always control nature, but you don't want to have this on your vacation either. There where some minor mold spots in the bathroom. Nothing serious but avoidable. The view and location are really great though. I would not tell others to avoid this place but can't recommend it either. It would say it was just enough overall."

"660772",12622513,180215364,"2017-08-09",138661198,"Timothy","We needed accomodation for a couple on a three week stay in the Silver Lake area with a car, for which this apartment was ideal. The location is close enough to Silver Lake Blvd to walk to the many, many cafes and restaurants south of its intersection with Santa Monica Blvd. It is just far enough from Silver Lake Blvd that the traffic noise is not an issue.  Communication and assistance from the host was excellent, including rapid attention to a minor maintenance issue.

The apartment is spacious, has a well equipped kitchen (though we never actually cooked). In addition to the queen bed in the bedroom, there is a large sofa bed in the living room (which we did not test). The ac for the living room and kitchen was more than adequate for July/August temperatures, and we understand that an additional ac is about to be installed in the bedroom. (We had no reason to test the heating!)

There is a shared washing machine and clothes dryer in the apartment block (no coins required). Given our three week stay with only one suitcase each, this convenience was greatly appreciated. There are only four or so apartments in this block and we never found the machines to be unavailable. (Bring your own laundry detergent.)

In front of this apartment is a paved area facing west with some garden chairs and a beautiful frangipani tree. In the late afternoon and dusk it is a great place to have a cocktail and watch the sun set behind the iconic palm trees hill across Sunset Blvd, while your laundry washes and dries nearby.

There is a large outdoor car parking space provided. The driveway is very steep - if you have a low vehicle, be careful not to scrape it on the hump or the curb.  Street parking is extremely limited due to the proximity to cafes and restaurants, plus the occasional movie being filmed in the area.

The location was convenient to most attractions that we visited, including downtown, Griffith Park, The Getty Museum, Glendale Galleria, The Grove, West Hollywood, Le Brea Tar Pits, LACMA.  We used the car for day and weekend trips away and Uber for visiting around LA - Uber X fares for the places mentioned ranged from $5 to $15 with wait times 3 to 6 minutes.

For the best local coffee we settled on Alfred’s (Sunset Blvd at Micheltorina). For lunch or dinner, we found the friendliest service (and the best pizza) at Mixed Co (Sunset at Hyperion). Conveniently, Pazzo Gelato is just across Hyperion.

For groceries and fresh produce, we shopped at the 99c store and (Website hidden by Airbnb) opposite each other on Sunset near Maltman.  We didn’t need it, but there is a traditional pharmacy at Lucile and Sunset.  Also near that intersection is Big Mac’s Liquor, and (highly recommended) the Oui Nail Salon."

If you're just getting into town or passing through as we were it's perfect, only a 15-20 minute drive from LAX without being industrial. You're quite literally a few steps from the beach but far enough down the strip that you're able to access some peace. Having access to the boards/bikes/skates was great since we were travelling light. If you're looking for a place that's fully quiet at night this isn't going to be that but it's relatively peaceful in relation to the rest of the strip. I would definitely book here again."

I was there with my teenaged son and we had lots of space for our luggage and we grocery shopped and ate one or two meals a day there.  While not fancy, it had tons of niceties - extra pillows, towels, shampoo, etc.  We rented a car and had no trouble finding parking on the street in front of the house.  It was extremely quiet and we slept well.  Everything was clean and comfortable - we used the heater/fireplace a couple of cool mornings but didn't need to try the A/C.  Communication was great."

Cooper is one of the best hosts I have stayed with on Airbnb because of his warmth and welcoming nature that makes you feel part of the family and the house. He was also flexible with check in and check out, which I appreciated.

The house is in a great location for visiting USC. It's about a 30 minute walk or short car ride to the center of campus, which made it perfect for my visit. It's pretty easy to get to other areas of LA by lyft of public transit, depending on where you're going. 

The house was clean and comfortable, and all of the housemates were friendly too. I ended up staying in the library room, which was equal to the blue room and nice to be surrounded by books.  If I'm back in LA I'll definitely stay with Cooper again!"

Description is accurate and the space includes extra amenities that you might forget while packing (sewing kit, meds, umbrella, etc and much more!).

Incredible home, with the best mattress you can sleep on. Lovely little touches in the home that just made staying here great.

Location was very ideal, my husband and I love walking, so walking on the beach down to Santa Monica was a fantastic walk- it’s about 2miles from Venice. 

The kitchen was wonderful. Great amenities... It was nice to stock up on food and goodies and cook them, just as we would do at home. 

We used Ubers wherever we could- especially when food shopping. 

Needed to wash our clothes and Inge kindly gave us her code to do so. Just made staying so simple and easy.

Would love to stay again!

Only issue, we landed quite late on Saturday evening, it was dark and there were homeless people looking in bins(After being at the house for 6 days, we became used to this especially as they mean no harm!) but upon arrival, we felt out of bounds especially as we couldn’t find the door to get into the house! fortunately a neighbour was out and could point us in the right direction.

I have never stayed at a BnB with so many amenities...lots of breakfast treats and juices in the kitchen, plenty of towels, paper products and even beach chairs and wake boards for the beach, even your own parking spot! Michelle has thought of everything you'll need for your stay.  Thank you so much Michelle. We will definitely be staying here again when we return to the LA/South Bay area."

The house was very clean and the space was very comfortable for my brother and I. The fridge door was locked which I was surprised to see but I understand how that may become an issue with cleanliness if people mistakenly leave their food in there. The only thing I would recommend is that Rai leaves some water bottles for her guests. We were quite thirsty when we were there if we hadn't brought anything back with us from our outing. All in all, my experience was a 9/10. Thanks Rai! "

Off the kitchen is a separate door with a roomy bedroom, a comfy bed, full bathroom (shower was a bit small, but worked for us!), a spacious closet, and an amazing wooden desk with windows opening to the backyard.

The area was a quiet neighborhood about 20 minutes away from downtown LA or Santa Monica Beach. David and Orly were very specific with check in instructions and have provided many basic house needs including silverware, dishes, shampoo, extra towels, etc. I would say the only problems I came across was the amount of bugs in the house-- I even found one crawling next to me whilst half asleep laying in bed, and the clogged kitchen sink/broken garbage disposal that made cleaning a little difficult.

Flat screen TV's were in the living room and each bedroom.  There was a Roku in the living room also.  Furniture and beds were all clean and comfortable.  There was a washer and dryer in the apartment.  The apartment has a balcony.  The balcony side faces the expressway so there is some traffic noise.  Wasn't an issue for us though.  

The kitchen had everything necessary to prepare meals: microwave, stove/oven, pots/pans, dishes, cups/glasses, cutlery, utensils, coffee maker, full-size fridge, dishwasher.  There were also some snacks, bottled water, condiments & seasonings.  

Cleaning items stocked included dish liquid, dishwasher detergent, laundry detergent, and other misc cleaners.

Stephen was most gracious and responded quickly when we needed to contact him.  He met us for checking out.  We are so glad to have met him and would gladly stay at his place again.  Thank you Stephen for making our stay so comfortable!"

Bo made it very easy to contact her and responded quickly. The place was 3 miles from downtown and the neighborhood was alright. Not the cleanest neighborhood and street parking was crammed but that's ok because her driveway has plenty of room to fit all your cars. Up to 4 cars. The appliances and tv in the house were older but the whole place is a little aged. I liked the home overall and it was perfect for our one night stay.

The only issue we had was with the heater that seemed to work only as we left. So we were a little cold.

First, everything advertised was exactly what I found upon arrival: Nice, comfortable, meticulously clean home and yard, private room and bath with a very comfortable bed and desk, well appointed kitchen and off-street parking. There were snacks and water in the room, plenty of towels, fresh linens, extra blanket and a combo air conditioner/heater to keep the room comfortable. Fresh coffee was always waiting for me in the morning along with a light breakfast. The ""light"" breakfast was my choice as I was told I could help myself to ANYTHING in their kitchen. William and his wife were perfect hosts - I felt immediately welcome in their home and, even with a family, I was never disturbed or inconvenienced. It was unusually cold for LA when I was there so maybe a space heater in the bathroom for those ultra-chilly mornings would have been the only thing missing. Otherwise, the experience was great. I would definitely stay here again when I return to LA.    "

No frills here and nothing much in the kitchen, but we mostly ate out so it wasn't a bother.  The noise from the area makes it hard to sleep if you are a light sleeper and the bedroom windows don't really close so its drafty and loud. It gets bright very early so bring an eye mask and earplugs would help as well. All that aside the location is amazing and its a perfect place to be in the heart of Venice beach life. Its also pretty roomy and comfortable."

There was even plenty of parking which as a pleasant surprise. The house is small but set up just perfectly so all six of us had plenty of space. Everything was sparkling clean and new. There were plenty of dishes, etc. The only thing to note is that there is almost no leftover food in the fridge or cupboards (ketchup, sugar, etc that often gets left at rental places) so make sure you bring everything you need. There is coffee and all the fixings though. I would definitely stay here again."

Plenty of street parking with the parking pass she supplies. The location was so perfect and close to everything we wanted to do that weekend but just enough into a residential neighborhood. Ubers only costed $5-$6 to WeHo. We especially liked the privacy/ secludedness of the guest house and had 0 problems with the people staying in the main house. Elizabeth is very nice and responsive, we didn't even have to contact her during our stay but I know that if we needed anything she would have been there to help. Overall, it was a good first airbnb experience for me and would definitely stay again over a hotel when I'm in the area."

We hope to return one day. High marks from the whole family!"

Renate und Ihr Mann waren sehr zuvorkommend und total locker .Den ersten Tag hatten wir ein Problem mit dem Kühlschrank und Renata brachte uns morgens ein komplettes spanisches Frühstück mit allem was das Herz begehrt.
Es war eine wundervolle Zeit bei Ihnen.
Ich würde es jedem Freund weitet empfehlen. "

The location was also great, with restaurants, bars, a cinema and a few shops just ten minutes away (and not touristy at all). As we only had one day and had already had a pretty packed trip we did things quite close by - the Hollywood Museum and the Griffith Observatory. There is a bus service called 'Hollywood Dash' a few minutes away which takes you to both of these (although we drove to the GO) so if you want a break from driving it's ideal, and a bus ride is only 50 cents. All in all, a perfect stay and would definitely recommend to anyone who wants to be fairly close (this is LA after all!) to the touristy spots but not in the thick of it, as well as anyone who isn't bothered about that kind of thing either."

It's strictly an Airbnb property, so it's a bit light on the lived-in touches (like having very few pots and pans to cook with), but it is plenty of room. If you're a group of 4, this will be VERY comfortable for you. Our group of 6 stayed here reasonably comfortably (with the single bathroom in constant rotation), but I wouldn't recommend the queen size fold-out couch with the plastic-wrapped mattress underneath, unless you have to.

That said, the location was perfect for us, and had amenities (multiple flat screen tvs) that we didn't even use. The host had specific rules posted in multiple spots throughout the place, but also went the extra mile to research and list restaurant/tourist ideas with maps to get there. Nice touch.

(Pro tip: if you're sure you're going to have a large group, book the group rate EARLY. Otherwise AirBnb's ""smart pricing"" feature will get ya!)

There were little issues, but overall, I'd definitely recommend this place. And the host was flexible, communicative, and responded to requests. Thanks Phillip!"

Check in was easy with the keypad, there's a parking spot, a sundeck to hang on when it's nice out. The airbnb itself is simple but all you need - a comfortable bed, nice natural light, and a clean bathroom and kitchen.

The space was beautiful with modern finishes, and thoughtful decorations that make this place feel like home. Everything was so clean & the bed was very comfortable. Although we never got around to using it, we enjoyed the fact that there was a coffee maker with Starbucks breakfast blend. In the closet you’ll find a microwave and mini fridge to store any water bottles (which we did). My girlfriend is very picky on where she stays while vacationing, particularly because of showers, and when I showed her the photos of Meghan’s place she was sold. When we arrived, she was thrilled!

He really made sure our stay was comfortable, yet wasn't intrusive in any way.  Bedroom is super comfortable and living room has double futon that could sleep an adult or a couple kids very comfortably as well as a nice couch that would actually be pretty comfy to sleep on, as well.  Although we didn't use it at all, the kitchen is beautiful, nicer than my own kitchen at home! This would be a great place for a family with a couple kids looking for a place where they could save some money by cooking some of their meals while on vacation.

Perhaps our favorite party, however, is that the house comes with use of two bikes.  My son and took them and rode about a mile down to the beach and along the Venice boardwalk.  Gorgeous!"

The home felt very new or newly remodeled, especially the bathroom.  Great shower! We only stayed one night, but loved being close to Venice Beach and all the fun spots near by! We enjoyed the Netflix and other channels on the Roku TV, and we were happy to have a small equipped kitchen to use (only needed the fridge, but for a longer stay we would have used the cook top)! 
Overall, great space in a good location.  Easy check in and out.  Thanks!! We would love to stay again."

I am not sure that I know the proper adjectives to completely describe our AMAZING trip to Daniel’s “South Los Munchies Home and Test Kitchen”.    
My Son and I stayed 4 nights at Daniel’s “South Los Munchies” and it could NOT have been a BETTER EXPERIENCE for him and I.....

Daniel is just an Incredible SUPER-HOST with an AMAZING VIBE, but he is an even better Person  and that is not an easy thing to do (Website hidden by Airbnb) 
I have stayed at many Airbnb’s all over the World but have never - and I mean NEVER - felt more “at Home and more Welcomed” than by Daniel and his “South Los Munchies Home and Test Kitchen”.

We even arrived earlier than our agreed upon Check-In Time but there were no issues as Daniel was beyond accommodating and had our Room and Amenities perfectly ready - nothing seems complicated with Daniel - and he even greeted us with a amazing brunch and helped us to immediately feel comfortable and to feel like we were at Home.

He helped us with Anything and Everything including his vast array of local Los Angeles knowledge of “How, Where, When & Why & What” to do, to eat, to see and when to go - and this is a big, BIG deal in L.A. !!!!!!!!!  

Do Not Wait or you will miss out on one of the “Coolest AIRBNB experiences” that you could ever have......  Hot Tub, Pool Table, Apple TV, etc., etc., etc. - oh and Daniel loves to make ‘Home Cooked Meals’ !!!!!   Like, “Seriously?”    YES, Seriously!!!!!

Keep up with ‘the 4-20’ and keep up with your awesome sense of Community and Beyond Cool Vibes Daniel.    

Cheers and THANK YOU !!!!!"

"10098",51922,61683057,"2016-02-07",14724252,"Alexandra","Stayed in Silvio's Airbnb in Santa Monica for two nights over the weekend. The unit we stayed in looked nothing like the unit on the ad. The blinds were dirty and dusty, one of the chairs in the room was broken, the furniture was very outdated and basic. Silvio did warn me about the noise - which is INSANE. If you're out and about at night it's no problem at all because the noise stops around 1:30 AM, however, if you're trying to stay in and relax at night - this is not the place for you. Silvio did not provide any instructions about our arrival check-in, until I had to reach out 30 minutes before check in. Wasn't told that parking was extra, so I think that was a little rude. The environment seemed very hostel-like. Totally fine if you don't care about cleanliness or noise. On the day of our check out, before I let Silvio know we were gone, a maid had already come into our room to start cleaning which I found very interesting. How did she know we were gone? Unsure. She also tried to blame me for breaking the chair in the room, which Silvio told me he would get fixed. Oh - forgot to mention the ""unit"" we booked originally, which was one floor higher up (away from the noise), was ""under renovations"" when we got there, so we were in a unit below the one we booked - again, RIGHT above the noise. I didn't think that was fair. Overall it was kind of a sketchy experience and I would only recommend staying there if you're never in the room, don't care about extremely loud music at night, and don't care if your room is clean.

There are two separate lines at the beach, one for runners, and one for cyclers, what is extremely convenient. The water is clean, and cool and is perfect for swimming. Plus, the place does not get too crowded ever, slightly more people at the weekend than during the weekday. Many shops are in walking distance, and there are splendid restaurants on the 2nd Avenue. The neighbor next door is a very good and friendly man, with a very good attitude, and it was always interesting to chat with him. He also was ready to give advice and help, when needed.

The goats, lama, and donkey were a highlight for them. The environment was so unique, so many fun places to explore! We were very comfortable and everyone we met at Zorthian was very friendly and helpful. Can't wait to book a ""grown-up"" adventure and get some writing done. A perfect place to get away from it all that's just a hop, skip, and a jump away from all the city offerings."

The place doesnt look like much from the outside, but the room itself was quite nice, clean and comfortable. You have to walk up about 2 small flights of stairs then take off your shoes at the entrance but there are sandals you can use if you don't like walking shoeless inside. The entry can be quite small if you have a big suitcase with you because the dining table is there. The kitchen itself is a decent size and is good for cooking (gas stove by the way). The room is to the very right, closest to the restroom so that was beneficial to us as it is shared. The room was very nice, great floors and beds and a desk area if needed. The bathroom was sketchy because the blinds were always up and you could see the apartments in the next building (still at a distance, take precaution when about to shower), but obviously you could put them down. Water pressure was great and you could use both the tub and shower at the same time! Overall, our experience was great, except for the having to share just ONE gate entry button and ONE room key between us. We had seperate plans for certain days and it made things difficult for us. Other than that, we really enjoyed the stay."

There are self-controlled heating and AC to keep the temperature however you like it. The lighting could use a little updating, as the only real light is above the bed and made the other end of the container a little dark other than a few strands of christmas lights. There is an exit sign hung above the door that is extremely bright when trying to sleep at night, but this was easily fixed by hanging a towel over it while we were sleeping. One thing to note, all the appliances were unplugged when we got in which was unexpected so we threw our food in the fridge and had to throw most of it away the next night because it wasn't running. The outdoor shower and port-a-potty were exactly as expected/agreed to. They were kept very clean and maintained. My only complaint there is the lack of privacy in front of the outdoor shower. It's faced away from the main part of the yard, but has clear views to a driveway where a car was parked and a fence that can pretty clearly be seen through. Overall we had a good experience and this is a great option especially if you don't plan to spend a ton of time there anyway!"

I was with my brothers and a friend so it was a good time since none of us minded the arrangement and allowed quality conversation and lack of laziness. Recommend highly for young people like ourselves. Nice, small porch allowed us relaxing mornings with coffee and numerous sunsets and rises with a surprisingly nice view. A short walk up a street adjacent to that street allowed an even better view. Lots of cheap food, clothing stores, laundromat and a Walgreens so close you could throw a ball to any of them. Coffee shops all over. Still kinda unfamiliar with LA but we seemed pretty central to where ever we went. Only available technological entertainment in the apartment is a tv with a lot of vhs movies; it's pretty nostalgic and if anything is good background noise and to glance at while you're doing whatever at night. Biggest problem for us was the shower since we'd all want one daily. It goes between hot as hell fire and cold as ice and requires some good patience, but just listen to what they tell you to do. They responded for every problem we had with it. Nice and simple, no regrets and a lot of fun."

Great art spots within walking distance: Blum & Poe, Museum of Jurassic Technology, Center for Land Use Interpretation, Arcana Books, etc.

Only downside, when I was there it was cold, and the wall heater took a while to warm the place up. But that's rarely a problem in LA.

Plan to stay here again!"

The exterior of the apartment is really nice, the exterior and decor  of the living room and bedroom is really cute. Then you get to bathroom which again you’ll think is pretty usually for a bathroom until you go to use it. The tub is literally made us clinch, you can tell they haven’t painted the tub in years, it was about 3 different colors, with no shower mat the drainage  was stopped up, and to top it off it was a bug that we jus couldn’t get it. We literally used the sink throughout our entire stay. I travel often and I’m use to hosts actually trying their best to accommodate you so you can enjoy your stay as best as possible, I didn’t get that feeling from this particular host. I landed in la at 9am asked if there’s a way to check in early, she said we can stay by the pool until it was time to check in, which wasn’t an issue. However our flight to leave  got rescheduled until later in the evening. I asked if I can pay her for additional hours/day because again I’m not from La and didn’t want to carry luggage around, she actually tried to make us leave an hr before our check out time, and then while we waiting in the pool area to get picked up, she kicked us off the premises because she said she had to pay her cleaner extra money, because she suggested we had a party. Knowing if had a party she would’ve been informed."

Pros: Easy check in, separate entrance, good size room, clean towels provided.

Cons: There is no restroom in the suite - you must go into the upstairs through the front door to use it. The room was moderately clean and the ceiling leaked in the corner.

Not bad for one night, but wouldn't recommend for long stays."

Her parking instructions were spot on, and the farthest we ended up parking once was less than a residential block away the rest of the time we were within one or two houses from the home.

The house was super clean. She was on top of maintaining supplies, basic toiletries etc. 

We were visiting family in Glendale as well as bouncing around the LA area doing tourist stuff. The location was great off the highway. All our Glendale running around was 10-20 min drives away. All our touristy main stuff (Hollywood Blvd, observatory, Chinatown) was about 20-30 min away with normal traffic.

The weather was very hot initially pushing 100 when we arrived. The room cooled down very quickly in the evenings using the fan and even got cold by morning time.

We had a very full schedule. The house is one we would have enjoyed having some down time to use the back fire pit, do some cooking in the kitchen etc.

 As an added bonus, there are two adorable, polite and friendly dogs. We have this place mentally bookmarked for future stays and we do look forward to staying here for future visits."

He was also quick to answer any questions or help with anything during my stay.
The location of this apartment is great, its a 2 minute walk to Echo Park lake and you can drive to Silver Lake in less than 10 minutes, there is also restaurants, bars and shops within a 5-10 minute walk. I stayed in the property on my own and felt safe, I read the review on the kids smoking outside near the flat, they did do this every other night but were not a problem. Parking was mostly easy as there are 2 options, Laguna and Crosby so this was mostly fine to find a parking spot. The apartment is huge even If there were two people, and there is a great little private terrace outside facing the Hollywood Hills. I stayed during some hot weather so my only negative would be that I could have done with an AC but I know from feedback this is something Dean is looking into.

The door is opened with a code lock, which also meant that we let ourselves in and had no contact with the owner or caretaker at any time. While we had to find out a few things for ourselves (such as where spare toilet paper and the ironing board were stored), clear instructions regarding parking permits, checkout, bins, etc. were provided.

I would highly recommend this apartment."

* 5 minutes drive to a state beach. 
* Down the mountain, local restaurants are close. Great sushi place & K bakery are recommended."

Vikki is a gracious and attentive host. She went out of her way to meet every one of our needs. A word of caution if you do not like or cannot manage stairs...there are two flights and a third flight up to the roof patio (which was a wonderful feature). My party and I are all fit and enjoyed the stairs, though it's something to take into consideration.

The place is perfect. Walking distance to grocery, WeHo, bus stop just around the corner, beverly center just 9mins walk, everything very convenient. His place is classy minimalist interior with perfect lighting! Very comfortable bed. The bathroom is private. Very clean! You got all you need in the place. Washer and dryer in the room concealed in a cabinet. Super convenient. And above it all, Felipe actually is one aaaawesome host! He toured me around WeHo. He was so nice he even inroduced me to his friends too! He is super very friendly, generous, funny and very nice. If there i (Website hidden by Airbnb) 10 stars available, I will definitely give more than the perfect star. I will definitely be renting his place everytime I am in LA. To all looking into renting his place, don't look around anymore, his place is the perfect place for those who want to be near Beverly hills, shopping, grocery, night life etc.  Book it now before somebody gets it! :)"

It is one of the most comfortable airbnb places I've stayed in to date. Dan & Nancy were excellent hosts and made me feel welcome in their cozy renovated basement apartment. I was in town for work, with a car, and with a fair knowledge of getting around Los Angeles. For me this location proved to be very convenient… although I'd hesitate to recommend it to anyone without wheels -- with the exception of visitors to Dodger Stadium, for which it is walking-distance perfect. Overlooking that this is not so much a ""garden"" apartment as it is the closest place to Elysian Park imaginable, this is a hidden gem of a rental. Highly recommended."

The location was great. It was close to lots of things and convenient location to go around in West hollywood.
The place comes along with a designated parking spot but it was a bit hard to park because it was right between the stairway and another parking spot. I wouldn’t be able to park if there wasn’t my dad. There was no heating system in the apartment but one small portable heater was available in the bedroom. There was no extra blanket as mentioned on first time we got there but Chris got it right away. Chris was quick on response but didn’t respond anything when I mentioned the broken lamp by the bedside (The apartment was pretty darkly lit). There is a refrigerator and stove but no cooking oil, salt/pepper or cooking pot. There was a small travel shampoo available in the bathroom but nothing else. If you are planning to cook/shower, you will need to bring your own. There was a clogging issue in the washbasin but Chris handled it that day. The sofa bed and bed were not that comfortable to sleep. 
Overall, it was pretty affordable and good stay in West hollywood. However, we probably wouldn’t recommend or go back to this place again."

My main problem is I don't think the house was professionally cleaned before we arrived, surfaces were cleaned but stairwells and washrooms could improve. Other than that, it was a nice pleasant place."

We rented the space for a company meeting for one of my team members traveling. This was indicated on the reservation multiple times. Still, she could not gain access to the space when she arrived and they refused to provide the access code even though she was listed on the reservation. 

The apartment is accessed via a security code which makes noise 5 minutes after you have entered the home. This was not communicated and it was very unnerving for our team member staying there. 

Canned communication came from several customer service reps while we were staying there (eg how is the stay? On night when we couldn’t gain access). 

I will DEFINITELY read all the fine print and look out for corporate owned apartments in the future."

Unfortunately, she is new to vacation rentals and her home was not as expected upon arrival. The pictures posted do not provide a true view of the home which was disappointing. I believe with a good cleaning crew, updated pictures of the bedrooms, professionally cleaning of the carpet, etc this will be a great rental. The home has such potential!! It’s in a quiet neighborhood, kitchen is awesome, living space is great and overall could be a comfortable space. Celile was very understanding of the concerns I had and is making improvements. She appeared to genuinely want things to go smoothly and I believe she will learn quickly how important it is to have accurate pictures so guests aren’t surprised. I would request photos of the bedrooms to include the carpet before booking; she stated the carpets would be professionally cleaned before the next guests. We couldn’t stay in the home in the current condition. I believe with a little experience and updates I’ve communicated to her this will be a great rental."

Everything about it is wonderful-the apartment, the succulents, Maiana, Punky, Grey Grey, Changu, little Manu.  My only regret is that I was in LA for work so I didn't get a chance to enjoy the place as much as I wanted to.  I'll need to come back to enjoy the fire pit.  Anyways, everything you read is true and more.  If you are here for work and work is downtown, then it's only a 10 minute commute--very dreamy for LA.

The location is convenient, you can easily walk to many good coffee shops, restaurants and shopping places. We stayed in the private room and shared the living room, but Feith was mostly out and let us use the entire space, so there was absolutely no inconvenience. We loved Chess the cat, he is the nicest and most friendly cat we’ve ever met. And Coco, a very small and cute dog. 
The only note is about the laundry facility at the basement. Many of the machines were out of order, and the ones working were occupied by other residents, so we weren’t able to use it at all during our stay. But it is more the building issue and not something Feith can fix. We drove to one of the laundromats.

The location is in a part of downtown that’s a little dicey, but there were still plenty of places to walk to for food and drinks. The 101 is fairly easy to access. This part of downtown could be an unwelcome culture shock for some, though. 

All in all, the room itself and the hosts were good but I would likely look to stay a few blocks away in a different part of downtown or a different neighborhood altogether next time."

I now have a new good reason to stay in Venice 'cause I found two amazing hosts. My first reason to come back again was the cool atmosphere of Venice, specially this neighborhood. Second reason is that you only need to walk 10 minutes to eat at the best diner ever, Café 50's or going down to the beach. I spent 8 days here, never needed a car. You have a lot to do just walking and riding. 
On my arrival, the airline company lost my suitcase but Tony handled that. He answered the calls, got my suitcase back. 
I'm a french girl and I traveled alone, it was my first airbnb experience. It truly rocked.
For those who wants to save money but still eat outside, go to La Fiesta Brava, The Mexican food truck on Rose or Café 50's (participate in keeping this place alive, thanks for your cooperation).
Miss you guys!"

My Husband and I (fiance' at the time) wanted to book a house for my friends and relatives who were flying in for our wedding.

We were rejected by so many houses because no one realistically wants a group of 20 year olds in the same place at the same time lol!
But not Richard, he let us book his place and was more than welcoming and more than kind.

I was absolutely beyond late for check-in because I had so much to do the day before my wedding and he was so nice and didn't even become upset that I didn't arrived until 10pm.

He greeted me with a smile and was very enthusiastic, meeting all of my friends and family. He showed us around the house and let us know his rules and I tried to do my best to make sure those rules were followed and that we kept the house as clean as possible.

There are not enough words to describe the great time that I had with my friends and family, the house was beyond gorgeous and the swings, trampoline, and all of the cool artifacts were BEYOND A DREAM! 
I hope that I was a great guest in the end and that he didn't feel disrespected.
 I couldn't keep an eye on all of my party animal friends and family, but I spent enough time tidying the house and putting everything in it's original home.

Richard is absolutely amazing and for any future guests, just keep in communication with him if you are late or there is a change in guest numbers, or if you have any general questions, he is super quick to get back to you, and is kind with every response.

Thank you Richard!
You made the night before my wedding so relaxing!"

I think there were a few issues but overall the place is good for the price range. The host doesn’t really respond to messages, she got mad at me for texting her asking for the property address two days before checking in since she didn’t  respond to the messages I sent via Airbnb. She had super loud music on all day almost everyday when she’s home. You can also hear people from upstairs. So if you want a quiet place to have good rest I suggest you to book somewhere else."

The main room is spacious, the bathroom and closet are quite large. The bathrom needed to be a it cleaner but, in general, the apartment was very nice. It is super well located, with easy access to public transport, supermarker, and coffee shops. Having acces to parking was a plus however, we had a very bad experience with it. On our  last day, when we were leaving in the morning to hang out for the day, the guys outside at the parking lot, told us that night the lot was rented to film people and we were not going to be allowed to park there. They instructed us to park inside the building at our return. When we came back at night, the security guy opened the gate of the inside parking for us and took us downstairs. We parked in the spot he suggested and asked us for our unit number. The next morning, when we tried to get the car to go to the airport it was gone. It was towed during the nigh. The resident owner of that spot called the towing company. The security guy, a different one, opened the gate to them. 
It was certaintly not Jeremy's fault but,  when I informed him of the situation, it was evident he did not cared. His only concern was how he could recuperate the parking ticket that was inside the car. 
It was a very stressful situation for us. We had to find the towing place and run to the airport not to miss our fly. Besides a quite expensive experience.  I do not know if Jeremy could have helped or not but his lack of care was disappointing."

He gave us recommendations for restaurants, groceries and shops, and always kept an open line of communication if we needed anything.

It was quiet yet incredibly central: within easy walking distance to the dorms, the village and (most importantly) the best bagels in town. Even better, the kitchen was thoughtfully stocked with a array of snacks and drinks, a keurig machine (plus a variety of gourmet coffees) and a large table with excellent lighting where she could work.

We had enough sleeping accommodations for everyone to be able to have their own space comfortably,  the kitchen has all the basics needed, the hot tub was wonderful, and the game room was an amazing perk!

This is not even in front of her door. This was downstairs. Her place had Mold. The same Odor that was downstairs. Was in her place. The place were a mess. Felt dirty and not clean. I tried to find another place to stay but couldn’t find anything. Sarah place had dried up blood in the shower area. I would not recommend this place to anyway. The location is nice and not too mention that it’s right over 2 nightclubs. The noise didn’t bother me or my mother. And she was very honest about the noise. But Sarah Place is a mess. I definitely won’t be staying there again. Soap scum in the shower as well. It’s just a mess. The sheets had spots on them as well as the comforter. One of the pillows was split open.

But our host was extremely proactive and did everything she could to make sure we had a nice stay. When we discovered that the water heater had died, she had it replaced in less than 24 hours! That is a pretty astounding turnaround.

The neighborhood is lovely. A crew was filming at a nearby house, so we got a little Hollywood experience in also.  Venice beach is a bike ride away, parking is easy, and the cottage is spacious."

She has wonderful taste, and the place is decked out with high-quality furniture and fun accents that make the small space inviting and charming. The location is also perfect for beach access, yet private and quiet and off the main street.  The bed is ridiculously comfy, and the place is warm and gets nice light. As a woman traveling alone, I felt completely safe there, and also was able to park my car on the same block as the cottage for the duration of my stay, which was super convenient. The only con for me was that the bungalow had not been professionally cleaned before my arrival and was pretty grimy (floors with visible dirt, etc.), so I had to do some sweeping, scrubbing, dusting, putting dishes away etc. before I could be comfortable unpacking my belongings there (despite being charged a cleaning fee). But given how sweet Linda was in general, I am pretty sure this was something she'll make sure to take care of for future visitors. I also can't recommend trying to cook in the kitchen as the cookware is *very* limited (there is also no microwave or coffee maker). But then, who comes to Venice Beach to cook?  All in all, highly recommended for everyone looking for fun, charm and flavor."

1. Easy and smooth check in: We’ve been using Airbnb for all our trips but first time that we actually did not met the host but not a big deal because they set it up where you can just show up and go to your room. Everything are ready for you. 

2. Very organized: From check til check out. They will provide all informations you need before you come. 

3. Clean apartment: The whole apartment is clean. Very homey. Like your on your own house. No smell, no trash/dirt everywhere, lovvveeee the kitchen (though we didn’t use it but it’s clean)

4. Big room: Oh me and my husband were very surprised when we saw our room. It’s spacious, clean, with AC (A++++), bed feels nice and clean, bed is roomy and floor is clean. 

5. Good price: The price is affordable. I would definitely come back. 

6. Highly recommended

7. Easy to communicate and very accommodating: Host will check on you every now and then and if you need anything. That for me is a plus. 

8. Easy parking: there are several parking spots at the back. It’s a first come first serve basis but when we stayed their, there’s actually only few spots taken, plenty of spots available. I would say always try to check first before you decide to use street parking. 

Once again, thank you for a great stay and we will definitely stay at your place again.

It is a one of a kind place, in a one of a kind location, with lovely people everywhere.  It couldn't have been better.  Fredrik's place is tasteful, clean, full of beautiful artwork and books, you really don't want to leave.  As you drive up the canyon, the view gets better and better.  You can take the tram to the house  - and it feels like time stops while the tram travels up the hill and you can see deep into the canyon.  Up on the rooftop deck, the view is even better with the twinkling lights of Los Angeles in the background.  The house has everything you might need, (beds were ahmaazing) and Fredrik is a wonderful host - very responsive and kind.  The country store and restaurant at the bottom of the hill (Pace) were fabulous too -- cool, kind people everywhere -- makes for a completely relaxing, respite from the busy city. We will definitley be back!

P.S.  Look up the history of Laurel Canyon and you'll see how this house fits in perfectly with the vibe."

Only downside was that there are very few pans if you want to cook.

There is a lovely swimming pool but the weather was too cool for us to use it.

The space was impeccably clean. Parking was a little tricky to get in and out of because of the narrow driveway and tight space but I really appreciate that they offered a spot at all! The neighborhood was quiet and Peaceful. I hope to stay here again. Thanks Andre and Alex!"

My room was big and comfortable and smelled nice, bedroom 1, but the rest of the house had a funny smell. It smelled really sour?! Also, there was lots of hair in the bathroom (female?!) and that was gross. I think the room is a bit on the overpriced side for what you're getting. Lastly, I was allowed to do a small load of laundry, since Jocelyn usually doesn't allow it, so glad about that. "

The room had a separate entrance and bathroom (room was connected to the next one by a double door that remains permanently locked on both sides but has about .5"" open space underneath so there is little by way of sound isolation -- but the guest staying in the other room was very attentive with sound, this was no problem for me at all).

1) The self-check in instruction is so clear that it should be the golden model for all Airbnb hosts.

2) You got your own bath here. Better than those “efficient units” where the bathroom is shared and cost more in LA. 

This is perfect for solo travels, I would consider staying again if I come to this area. 

Note there are some stairs, so if you are not traveling light there’s some work to do. Also no refrigerator and microwave. There’s some noise but tolerable. I am a light sleeper but it didn’t bother me. "

We stayed in the room that didn’t have a balcony but got to enjoy the view of the shared balcony of the living room downstairs.  Elaine’s is truly in the Malibu hills, I felt like I was glamping!   It takes about 20-25 mins to get to Hwy 1 from house due to the curvy roads but once you get to Hwy 1 you are in the heart of Malibu! If you prefer walking distance and/or short rides to places then you might want to consider a different location however Lyft/Uber can pick you up at Elaine’s house! Which we did on one night about 22-25$ each ride.  I agree with everyone Elaine is sooo welcoming and has a warm heart!!! Thank you Elaine!"

My family and I were taking a trip to Universal Studios, Hollywood for the first time.  We had to contact the host while driving from Northern Ca. to Southern Ca.  Just about an 2 hours prior to arriving I sent a text advising we were going to get into the area about an hour sooner than expected.  The host told us that check in is at 4 due to making sure the rental was thoroughly cleaned.  I agree'd and we continued on.  When we finally  arrived after the 500 mile excursion, we pull up to an apartment complex which was fine.  We get the key to the parking garage, start unloading all of our belongings which is quite alot hence being 4 people.  When we opened the door there was a scent that did not smell sterile or that it was just cleaned.  We take a look around as soon as we did that the problem arose.  The unit was not cleaned what so ever!  I have pictures to prove.   There was dust everywhere, there was an old moldy what looked like possibly a smoothie or milkshake left in the fridge, A black old sponge in the kitchen sink, crusty left overs on the rice cooker as well as the pans.  The list goes on and on.... I immediately call the host to advise that we had a problem.  His response was, ""OK? do you want your money back""?   I am so sorry , I know you and your family just drove a long distance and I want to rectify or try to resolve this. Nothing, he simply stated do you want your money back?  I couldn't believe what I was hearing, who wants to show up to the rental they booked a month in advance for a family vacation to then show up and have to panic attempting to find another place to stay, mind you there are kids.  We, said yes we want our money back, now what do we need to do?  Will you the host contact airbnb?  His response was ""yes I will and I will tell them what happened and you will get your full refund.""   We  said fine,  how long before we get the money back?  He then replied ""I am not sure I will contact and see what they say""  We reloaded all of our belongings back into the car and had to find  another place to stay.  We contact airbnb to advise and discover that the host is denying our money back now after he promised a full refund."

Close to Universal Studios and Metro Station which can take you anywhere. Lyft was under $12 to Downtown Hollywood.   Super clean as other reviews mentioned (that was the selling point for us).
We had plans to go out every evening of our two night stay and opted to stay in just because the space was so inviting and cozy.   
Totally missed enjoying the outdoor patio but we hope to be able to stay here again and get a second chance.

If you plan to check some famous tourist spots of LA, here is the prime location. Richard tried his best to meet our needs. Our flight was delayed until midnight. Richard had arranged everything well so we self-checked in easily. The street parking is very convenient btw. To help keep the room clean, shoes are required to be removed when entering. So if you don’t want to touch the floor directly, bringing home slippers will be helpful. The only thing I concerned was the mattress was too soft for me. But my mom thought it was okay for her.

Amazing location, 10-15min drive away from Hollywood/Griffith Observatory/Ktown/Downtown/Silverlake, and a 10min walk from Larchmont Village, but still very quiet. The apt was on higher floor, so there was a lot of natural light and we were able to see fireworks from the windows on July 4th. The co-host Dave helped us check in, showed us where to park (gated garage is located on the basement floor), and led us to the unit. There were ample couches/seating/tables, so it was convenient to work in as well. Would definitely recommend this place if you're visiting LA and want to be in a quiet place close to major landmarks.

Keep in mind the building is historic so it didn't have a garbage disposal/dishwasher if you intend to do a lot of cooking."

The room is located in the backyard and is a self-contained unit. I doubt though if it's big enough for 2 people, it's tiny and floor space is limited so if it's only for a place to sleep, it could be ok. Yet it was all that I needed during my stopover. If you're a light, or early sleeper, you have to take into consideration that the ceiling and walls are thin and you can hear conversations as well as the TV from the apartment above the unit you are in. However, it goes quiet promptly at midnight. The bed was very comfy and the bathroom small but convenient. For this stopover I didn't need to warm up food or store it in the fridge as there are great restaurants and coffee places just a few blocks away.  "

Parking is a nightmare and very unclear on the instructions with a choice of one very busy street as the only option given.

The shared bathroom was of good size, however, the amount of people staying in each flat meant that it was usually in use and thus meant that using the toilet or shower was an issue."

Det negativa var att det fanns inget kök i studion. Vi kunde inte laga mat hemma i 10 dagar. Endast ett kylskåp och en mikrovågsugn. Studion är ett före detta garage. Golvet är ett målat garage golv som känns smutsigt och slitna. Inte trevligt att gå runt på. Duschen sprutade vatten rakt ut ur dusch-dörren och det skulle ha varit bättre med en handdusch. Men det värsta var bullret från bilar och flygplan. Studion ligger exakt intill en flygplats och det är också mycket stora plan därifrån från 9:00 till 21.00. Studion ligger i en mycket trafikerad gata. Vi hörde trafiken varje timme dag och natt. Det var outhärdligt och det är mycket svårt att åka in och ut i den stora korsningen. Vissa taxibilar fastnade med den nedre delen av bilen på uppfarten när det var som en kulle där. Jag tycker att värdarna måste vara mer ärlig med buller från flygplan och bilar och de bör också lägga ett trevligare golv i studion. Vi betalar mycket pengar för att bo där och då kan man kräva att det skall vara betydligt bättre standard än det var. Cyklarna var rostiga, fula och mycket gamla. Om vi skulle bli bestulna på dem var vi tvungna betala 2000 SEK för dem. De var knappast värda mer än 100 SEK."

I was quite disappointed when I walked in and a 5-inch spider started crawling on me while I was turning on the A/C, which I then had to kill. That didn’t start the night off well for me. Also, I tried running the drier on the settings exactly stated on the directions but it kept turning off five minutes after I turned it on. Probably user error but that was unfortunate. Lastly, the pillows on the bed were stained yellow and uncomfortable. For $121/night you expect at least some level of cleanliness and comfort and unfortunately that wasn’t quite the case. "

Elizabeth's drought resistant garden in front was beautiful. We needed to take some photos to see if any of the succulents will work for us at home in Albuquerque. The gravel and flagstone path to the cottage past the front hours (theirs) was somewhat hard to maneuver with suitcases.
The back garden with lawn and lounge chair was great though the weather was not so conducive to lounging. Must be great for spring and fall and cooler summer days.

First of all you will enter a very clean and good organized luxury House. Then you gonna have the best vegan Breakfast ever and sleep on very comfortable beds.
We were even invited to dinner, had some wine together, philosophizing about life and laughed a lot together! M&J are super fun, cute and very helpful. They have borrowed their bikes and even the GPS to us! 
Conclusion: book it, enjoy it, miss it and go back again!"

Not far from the sunset bulevar and downtown. Good bus connection. 3-5 minutes walk to sunset, 2 small stores, bakery, BBQ restaurant, bus stops. It was a good stay.
Enjoyed the the sunny breakfasts on the porch.
Thanks Dary!"

Karlyn made our move so much easier and comfortable. Her home is beautiful and clean. We LOVED the spacious private layout and massive modern kitchen to cook in. The large bedroom with the private modern bathroom made our long stay extremely comfortable. The french doors of the bedroom open to a massive deck that overlooks the hills, perfect for a morning coffee with a view. The location is extremely convenient if you need to hop on the 101 freeway or head over to Sunset where there are plenty of coffee shops/restaurants.

The room is great, well appointed and spacious. Just far enough away from the main house to be private while close enough to engage with the guys in the house if you choose, and I suggest you do. We were greeted with a warm welcome and shown to the guest house. Everything was very clean and the added touches of some organic snacks, tea’s and coffee were gratefully received. Nina went out of her way to make sure we were happy and at ease. 
I cannot recommend Nina’s guest house highly enough. We will miss the house, the pool, the location (which is perfect for experiencing LA) but mainly theses wonderful people, who we now call friends.
My only warning when staying here would be that once you have been here for more than a day, you may never want to leave, we certainly didn't!
And we will definitely be back.

His sweet kitty Ole was great to have around, and while I loved her company, she's the kind of cat that won't bother you if you don't dig cats.

First, had a terrible miscommunication and for the most part on the host's end. Secondly, as we checked in, family was on the same floor as our private room. House was messy, but the room was clean. The family was a little loud during our stay. I didn't mind that much because I knew that the family was staying there, however it got loud at some point and my bf and I was resting trying to get some sleep during the day and the noises woke us up early in the morning. I wouldn't recommend this if you want privacy and something peaceful and quiet. Maybe it's good if you only need a place to crash at night. Overall, the stay was okay."

It was centrally located in the newly established Franklin Village, literally 2 blocks away from Birds, UCB, La Poubelle, and The Oaks. Parking is tough if you're renting a car. Street-sweeping on Mondays and Tuesdays had us up at 6am to find a new parking spot. The room is connected to the main house and you can hear other tenants clearly through the walls. The nook is a modified closet with a fridge (which was nice to have!) and a coffee machine. There is no TV in the room. It's just a wardrobe, a vanity, and a plastic clothing rack. The tub was awesome, though, and never ran out of hot water. Host does ask for you to clean dishes/take out trash/etc when you leave. I was not able to contact the host upon arrival, but maybe they just don't get text messages or emails. We didn't spend much time in the room since we were exploring all day, but it's a really good deal in a cool part of LA! "

When me and my girlfriend first arrived parking was easy and so was getting into the apartment. Everything is accessible through the keypad. The place was bigger then we thought and had just what we needed. There is Roku set up on the TV so you will be entertained for hours. Plenty of kitchen cookware and utensils to cook up a meal if you don’t feel the need to spend money. Not to mention the location is GREAT. It is literally in the heart of K-Town! Food and bars are about a 10 minute walk. 
Everything about this was great will definitely book again!

P.S.

During our stay, when we checked out I had forgot my watch. When I returned about 25 minutes later to see if I can still get into the Airbnb there were cleaners that Justin had been working with for years inside cleaning the apartment. 

I asked one of them about my watch and he went over to a older female and asked her and he retrieved my watch back for me. Thank you so much for this! This restores faith in humanity. Your workers deserve a raise for being honest! Thanks again."

The premise of the NYT article was that it is possible to have great LA holiday without a car.  This amazing property makes it possible.  The Mount Washington Yurt is a 5 minute walk to a gold Metro line stop and four stops from Union station and from there LA is your oyster.  We hit most of the spots highlighted in The NYT series; 36 hours in Downton LA,  and 36 hours in LA Koreatown LA, and still managed to fit in a Dodger game.  However I must say the highlight was returning to this private hillside yurt,  taking a shower under the stars and falling asleep and waking up in the magical setting.

She is so welcoming! We arrived with a damaged suitcase and we were greeted with wine, fresh fruit and snacks after a whole day's travel. She even asked us a few days before we arrived what kind of wine we preferred.

It's in a decent neighborhood, a 12 to 15 minute drive to the Library and Botanical Gardens, and closer to Old Pasadena.  The apartment is roomier than the pictures indicate (guessing around 800 square feet).  It's not brand new, and not a hotel, but the residence is clean and full of charm.  It's situation on the main level of a up/down duplex in an early 19th c. house.  If you want a comfortable home-away-from home that is tastefully decorated and generously supplied with enough towels and a few kitchen essentials, this is your place.  We were very at home here.

However, health issues demanded a departure from the norm so we checked out airbnb at the urging of a dear friend who has happily used it multiple times, and thus we found The Cozy Foothill Retreat.  And it was indeed cozy, but much more than that: The location was ideal for our purposes, the neighborhood and home beautiful, the guest accommodations comfy and stylish, the breakfasts delicious (the homemade from scratch almond croissants were exceptional), the hosts friendly and welcoming, even the family pets lively and entertaining. We heartily recommend a stay with Will and Lynne and would most definitely return ourselves if the situation presents itself. After only 3 days there, we felt like old friends and were quite sad to have to go."

John and Mark were both promptly responsive to questions and John was able to be there when we checked in, although the instructions for getting in ourselves would have been perfectly accurate and easy to follow. The “villa” is bright, cheery and tasteful and the beds were really comfortable.  The location is ideal for the beach and it’s a real perk to have a private parking spot in that neighborhood.  Prospective guests should know that the Villa requires a flight of stairs, which was no problem for me, but just FYI. We liked being higher up because it’s brighter. Everything was spotlessly clean when we arrived. The owners were also accommodating in working it out so we could leave a couple of hours later than the usual check-out time.

This was a fun, unique, and comfortable glamping-type getaway, managed by a friendly and thoughtful host. The restored Shasta is a cozy sleeping space, with enough room for a few bags and a few outlets for charging your devices. The outdoor areas and pool were cool and eclectically decorated hang-out spaces, with occasional guest appearances from Guiseppe's two cats. The outdoor shower was private and pleasant. And, best of all, Guiseppe (and his wife, Kathy) were thoughtful and made sure I had the things I needed, from coffee pods to extra towels. Plus, this part of Los Feliz is just a few blocks' walk to the commercial strips of Hillhurst and Vermont. I mostly walked (or used ride-share services to visit other parts of L.A.). I had a hard time leaving, and hope to come back!"

Two friends of mine, my boyfriend and I stayed for a whole week and it was a perfect place to relax after a long days of exploring. She was also kind enough to give us the extra keys so that we didn't have to coordinate schedules with the keys. She was fast at replying to our texts and was very helpful when we had questions. If we ever come back to LA, we defiantly would come back here to stay! "

Situated in a lovely residential neighborhood, it was walking distance from a major intersection with many amenities and not far from I-405.  Coming and going was made very easy by the spacious outside entry point, the spacious elevator, and wide hall leading to the apartment door.  Sheryl gave it all her very personal, humorous touch, with written instructions and helps.  We don't have a pet any more, so it was nice to have visits from the attentive Colby.

The apartment is tucked in a small, unassuming complex, but it proves to be an extremely pleasant, even fun, hideaway inside. Well-appointed, with a full kitchen, comfortable living room, and cozy bedroom, the unit is great for at least one or two guests. 

Matthew also included a few nice touches, including a basket of clean towels, hotel-style toiletries, and a helpful guidebook he’d prepared. Altogether, the apartment was a great place to relax and rest after a busy day.

And, being just a block from Santa Monica boulevard, it’s no more than 15 minutes’ walking from the WeHo clubs, and closer to several decent restaurants."

Duy was around as well and was so sweet :) for the most part you do your own thing and if you are an early riser like me, opt to just move your car in the morning. Walkable distance to corner stores 7/11, and target i believe. Perfect area, perfect stay, beautiful home. 5 stars, will hopefully get an opportunity to stay again!

When my flight arrived late, she was so sweet and she offered to wait for me to check in
 ( despite having her own plans for the evening. ) She knew I would be exhausted from a full day of traveling and she very kindly offered me a light snack when I arrived. 

I was really busy while I was in town, and although we didn't get to see each other often, I really enjoyed our brief (but meaningful ) conversations. 

Celeste's home is gorgeous. She has great personal style and I found myself pining over her elegant furniture. ( Her sofa looks like something out of a Veronica Lake movie! )
She lives in a lovely neighborhood and I slept really well every night. I really appreciated the en suite bathroom, fluffy towels, and full-length mirrors.

This home was spotless, beautifully decorated, and in a quiet neighborhood. I loved the washer and dryer (after staying in a hotel all week) and the yoga mat was a great touch!

It is really close to the airport, which I was a tad concerned would make it noisy...but surprisingly wasn’t an issue at all. 

It is right around the corner from several shops and restaurants (and a Trader Joe’s) and we felt very safe taking our three children around with us.

The AC kept the living area really cool, but didn’t really reach the bedroom. Thankfully, the ceiling fan and floor fan were able to keep us mostly comfortable at night. 

Sara was very quick to respond, gave us very specific directions that made the home easy to find, and took great care of us. We were the second people to stay in this particular place, so she asked us to let her know if anything was missing. We mentioned a few small details that would be nice, but we were fine without and she ran them right over! 

Overall, we had a GREAT experience and would definitely stay again if we find ourselves in the LA area. I highly recommend it!"

The neighborhood sells itself and you're a cheap Uber from a lot of other great places. Really comfy bed and great shower pressure. Chalk board wall is a nice touch too. Highly recommend this place"

Hope is super friendly, helpful and  had left things in the room that a weary traveller would appreciate.

The location is great as you're in the heart of West Hollywood.  You'll have a great night's sleep as the bed is super comfy and the shower is great.

I would love to stay back with Hope if I am back in LA.  i totally recommend this place."

I also was not informed on what apartment number it was. I called the guy renting out the Airbnb  a handful of times  but I got no answer so communication was not too good on that part , so I had to go around every apartment and look underneath the mats for the keys that he said he left. The apartment was okay it isn't the nicest but it isn't the worst it does not have a TV and it did not smell very clean my worst complaint was that every single morning there was a gate that was opening and closing and being slammed  so don't expect to sleep in, if you're going to be staying here. But because of the fact that I did not like the Airbnb I was not there as much as I would normally be and it helped me get out more which I really enjoy but I will not be staying here again"

It was clean and spacious and the back porch made it possible to enjoy the beautiful southern California weather while having a business meeting.

It was convenient to have a safe place to keep the car too.  It was a cozy place to have as a homebase while we toured LA.  The neighbors were friendly and everyone has a cheerful dog.  Adorable!  
We fell in love w Zinqué, both for dinner and breakfast/brunch.  We went 4 times!  GTA pizza was fabulous also.  We recommend the High Rooftop bar above the Hotel Erwin for Venice Beach sunset viewing.  We rode rental bikes down the beach to Santa Monica Pier, walked through Palisades Park, and then soaked in the Santa Monica Beach sunset views from Onyx rooftop bar at Hotel ShangriLa.  If you have time, the Getty is a gorgeous museum with breathtaking views, and The Griffith Observatory is a must!  There’s a Frank Lloyd Wright in Barnsdall Park called Hollyhock House you can tour (if you’re into architecture), and the park views are stunning.  It’s close to Griffith Park so you can do both the same day.  We even saw Andie MacDowell when we were brunching at Figaro Bistrot!  Recommend Covell wine bar after the Griffith for an incredible wine list.
We had a lovely stay!  Thank you for everything!"

Everything was easy and great: convenient parking spot, easy access to the apartment, nice welcome, everything super clean and everything had great quality.

We didn't need any help during our stay, but she offered that we could reach out if we needed anything. The guest house was perfect for what we needed. It was quiet (didn't hear any noise), comfortable, and close to great food. The wifi was quick and we were able to control the thermostat with the Nest app. Everything we needed, including directions for the Nest app, wifi, and TV were clearly listed in a binder, as well as some nice suggestions for food in the area. The full kitchen was great, although we didn't have time to utilize it. The place is well laid out for a studio space. I've never considered living in a studio before, but staying here opened my mind to consider it in the future. 

Overall- I don't love visiting LA (coming from living in the more peaceful mountains), but this place made our trip so much better and certainly much more relaxing. Thank you Jocelyn for your wonderful hospitality!"

We love the neighborhood especially because it is across the street from our son's apartment but even so it's a safe, very attractive neighborhood with lots of interesting places to explore including Echo Park Lake, Elysian Park, many coffee shops and cute boutiques and many many great restaurants in walking distance.  We even walked downtown one day with a stop midway at our favorite Taco Restaurant on Sunset.  There are many nice touches in the home including the pleasing decor, not completely empty refrigerator and lots of coffee with two styles of coffeemaker; fully equipped bathroom with loads of towels, sheets, blankets; very comfy bed; washer/dryer and outdoor deck that catches sun for 3/4 of the day and has a lovely view. Also Erika is a super host - when I contacted her on the first day looking for lids for her cookware she overnighted two new top grade saucepans to us!!

As others have noted, it's a very busy street. They are also doing construction across the way, which ends around 3-4pm but may be a consideration for some.

A little longer walk to the shops/restaurants on Abbot Kinney. 

The place looks like the pictures. It’s not a luxurious spot,  but very comfortable and Bohemian with a large back yard. The draw of this place is the location and it’s a great deal for the price.

Even though the location is central to all of our desired destinations throughout the Los Angeles and greater area, parking was a major issue. Every night we were forced to park in visitor parking which hosts a limited amount of spaces. Each night all spaces were taken and we were left to circle the parking lot for at least 45 minutes to an hour until a space opened-up. We were also not told until we arrived that there was a fee of $10 every day we used visitor parking. Since this was our only option (we did not want to park our rental on the busy street--and there was no parking to be found there either) we had to pay $40 extra by the end of our trip due to our use of visitor parking. 
The apartment is mostly clean but the beds are uncomfortable. However, we were so exhausted from our daily adventures that this did not matter and we all slept wonderfully each night. 
Overall, this is a great apartment with major parking problems. But the space is beautiful and provides a dreamy view of Los Angeles. The area is safe and up-scale and provides short access to all the major attraction the city of angels offers. "

Being somewhat reluctant to venture far away from the standard “hotel” experience (after a lifetime of work travel in hotels), it was hard for me to visualize using a service like AirBnB. 

As times have changed - so have I - and I have learned that services like ride sharing have changed the very way I travel for work and leisure - so it was time to take the plunge!

LA in general is VERY intimidating — having been 5 years removed of being a SoCal native, I didn’t have a clue on where to stay nor where to go and how to handle my trip planning.  I was set out to travel with my wife to leave the Vegas heat for some fun in Los Angeles.  

K.J. is an LA native (or at least I think he is) and knows the city inside and out.  We were able to take in some sights and do some fun (and low cost) tourist destinations — while keeping traffic a non-issue.  

It’s not where you’re going, but when, and what direction.  K.J. happened to know these things and I only hope he knows these tidbits for ALL that LA has to offer.   Who likes spending quality time in LA traffic??  

Not only this, but the place is super clean, and has a very casual and relaxing feel to it.  

If you want to try to take a step away from hotel life - give K.J. a try - it was a welcome change and my first (of many in the future) AirBnB experiences.  

Thank you from my wife and myself!

It is within walking distance to several tourist attractions, including The Grove. While I found it easiest to use public transit, there is plenty of street parking should one decide to have a car during their stay. The guesthouse is very quiet, clean, modern, cozy, peaceful, and safe. The host, Reiko, was communicative and available via phone at all times should I need anything. She made sure the place was well appointed with everything I needed, right down to the laundry detergent. The pics of the place on the airbnb website are exactly what you can expect when you arrive.

Private room with a lock, and hardly ran into our neighbors, so it felt as if we had the bathroom to ourselves. It is tremendously quiet, so you can hear everything! If you're a light sleeper; don't do it. You can hear everybody's footsteps and walking around in their rooms. The bed is firm and low on the ground, which we didn't mind, we prefer firm beds. Pillows super soft, microwave, mini fridge, and a small heating unit provided. That heating unit came in handy at night. We couldn't get the windows to close unfortunately, seemed like it was stuck; so on went the heater. Contacted them and said they would have someone over to check it out; not sure if they did or not, we weren't home most of the day and window was still open when we left. Nice quiet area, metro near by and lots of little shops and dinning areas available and well as a 7/11 literally down the street. Overall very nice for our stay and the areas we visited!

You will have parking in front of the building.

There is even a grill outside!

I traveled with a few co-workers for a store visit in Venice. When I booked this location and was sent a confirmation, the address listed was incorrect. Looking from my mobile device, the address that Airbnb says ""congrats you're going .., "" is the one I set in our navigation. It wound up taking us to East Pasadena which clearly isn't Venice. Once we arrived at the wrong house and looked further into the ""house manual"" it lists the actual address which is located in Venice. We were in LA for several store visits which took us from Newport Beach, to WeHo, and Venice so I didn't think twice about this until we arrived at a random house. We stayed one night and since we had gotten in so late due to the address issue, I tried multiple times to get in touch with Jason by email and text to see if we could extend our check out by one hour. To his credit, he did respond and offered to let us keep our bags in the house until 2PM, but we had already checked out by the time we heard back.

Check in was simple and it was nice to be have access to a large garage. The house backs up to the canal which is stunning. We were only there for one night, but it looks like a little boat is available to drop into the water. Location is great and the neighborhood was very quiet and quaint. 

Luckily were were only there for one night. If you care about cleanliness, this house isn't for you. The carpets are matted with black yuck, there are visible cobwebs throughout (and in easy to reach places), the shower curtain has mildew on it, most window screens are caked with black nastiness, window coverings do not keep out the light/or they're missing all together, photos of the house make it look modern & clean, but the house is dated and in needed of upkeep, the kitchen counter had food residue from the guest prior,  and if we had actually planned a long stay, the kitchen barely had any amenities ... and all glasses were filthy.

The good, is that the roof has a deck and the back patio below overlooks the canal. If you are just there to sleep, be outside, and want to centrally located, you may be happy here. Otherwise, for the cost, I'd look for something more comfortable and clean."

1) View is unbeatable. Enjoyed the ocean view from the living room and the kitchen. You can hear the ocean in the bedrooms.

4) You can walk to the beach using a walkway and is very convenient.

Cons
1) The house is not clean. It looked like it was cleaned long time ago. Kitchen pots and pans are not very clean. I walked into the bathroom for the first time with a couple wet towels on the floor. 
2) AC was not working. We had trouble sleeping in the night as the rooms were really hot even after keeping the windows open all the time."

I really didn't know what to expect. I was pleasantly surprised. The apartment was nice and comfortable. The area was quiet and safe. Paul (Property Manager) was awesome. He made us feel welcome and took the time to send us a few places to check out while we were in town. If I make another trip to LA, I will definitely book this apartment again. "

La parte esterna del giardino è davvero deliziosa e l'abbiamo sfruttata al massimo ogni sera che mangiavamo a casa. Se si vuole fare surf in casa ci sono delle tavole a disposizione, la spiaggia non è vicinissima e in questo caso dovevamo prendere la macchina, ma se si vuole solo andare a farsi un bagno e prendere un po' di sole si può arrivare in mezz'oretta a piedi o con le bici, anche quelle a disposizione. Jake è gentilissimo e ha sempre avuto una risposta immediata.

Aside from common LA traffic being located right by the freeway made the commute to and from any destination convenient. The home is safely tucked into a gated property at the end of a cul-de-sac.

Here are some comments though that I think people should be aware of: the AC is a bit hard to function around as it doesnt really get cool. It is super noisy and it sounds like something is going to explode. It was really hard to sleep at night due to that reason. However, I am positive that Angie will do her best to fix this issue as soon as possible.
Another thing that I wanted to comment on is that there were dust spots around the apartment that were not cleaned very properly. The kitchen cups and glasses also had stains on some of them. Again, I am sure this is 100% fixable and Angie will work on it immediately.

Thank you Angie for having us stay over!"

It is less than clean, has no real bathroom facilities, they are out in open next or nailed to a tree, no drains for shower as one steps on dirt. So unless one is looking for an outdoor experience, short of being in the outbacks, this option is far from ‘glamping’. The host is charming and a nice person, however has ways to go ‘fixing’ the space before it can be an urban oasis as depicted. I had a great time speaking with the host, space aside, but I want to ensure my feedback will highlight what the realities were so one is not dissapointed upon arrival, and has to swich next day to more basic/normal accommodations. The bathroom set up was the ‘cannot stay like this’ for me, and the price for not having a real bathroom and clean/sanitary amenities."

My stay there would have great except that when I arrived, I was informed that the kitchen disposal and sink were clogged and a plumber would come later. I was there 12 days and it wasn't until the 10th day that a plumber was going to come but by then I didn't want to have anyone come in while I wasn't there nor wait for anyone. So I couldn't use the dishwasher and had to wash dishes in a big bowl that couldn't be drained in the kitchen. "

Joe greeted us at check-in and showed us around the apartment. He gave us a free parking spot and suggested a great sushi place for dinner. Very nice and accomodating person. He even let us leave our bags in the apartment past check-in which turned out really good for us as we had a late flight out.

The apartment is exactly as shown in the photos. All furniture was great especially the bed. If you like soft comfortable beds this one is for you.

5 out of 5 experience at this place."

There is a bike shop down the road which is about a 5 minute walk. It is only a 10 minute bike ride to the beach, and very close to shopping districts, like Abbot Kinney. Santa Monica and Venice were very close by driving and also biking. It is an $8.00 Uber. The house was very warm and welcoming. Paul's dog Champ was the cutest! Paul always wet out of his way to make us feel very comfortable. He even made us dinner on the last night! It was an outstanding experience and I will definitely be staying there again.

It's clean enough, but it's no frills- feels like a dorm. But that's exactly what's in the description, so no complaints here- it's a central location with parking at a decent rate. I never used the kitchen, and the shared bathrooms were fine as shared bathrooms go- my only complaint would be that with so many rooms and only two bathrooms, you better get up early if you want to shower. It wasn't always easy getting a free bathroom to use. If you need a simple room to park your stuff at while you're out and about enjoying LA, this fits the bill."

The guest house was neat, clean and exactly as described. There is no AC which is not usually needed in that climate.  We were in town during a bit of a heat wave so it could get a little warm inside but overall the ceiling fan still did the job. Paul was easy to communicate with and very accommodating.

There is a dedicated parking space afront. The place is located close to the downtown, but the district itself is not very good - dirty, and a lot of homeless people. Also, neighbours may be very disturbing with a loud music. Daniel is a very good host - communication was superb, no problem with that. Overall, the property is good enough to spent a few nights in LA."

The lights flickered constantly and there were frequent issues with turning on one appliance and having the lights dim. Also, please note that the actual check out time for this place is 11am, not 12pm as listed on this site.

The area is is super sketchy. There are multiple vagrant camps all around and the streets and sidewalks are filled with trash. The only good thing about this stay was the check-in process. The key is in a lock box outside the entrance to the apartment so you just grab the key and go. As far as the actual apartment goes, good luck. The apartment shown in the photos was not the apartment that we stayed in.  I expressed my concerns to Anya and she stated that this was in fact the same apartment. This cannot be possible since the layout is flipped so the bathroom and kitchen are on the opposite side of the main living area. Also, the photos make the apartment look very updated and clean. This was not the case. Everything was dirty. The shower curtain looks as if it has been used for many years, the bed frames and comforters had many many stains on them, and the floors felt like they needed to be swept and mopped. After buying food from the grocery store, we discovered that the refrigerator (which was not the same one in the photos), did not work. After notifying Anya of this issue, she stated that it was working before we checked in and never offered to have it fixed. 
After seeing many cockroaches in the apartment,  I notified Anya to which she replied saying that no one else has mentioned them. 
After expressing all my concerns to Anya, she stated that I could cancel and that it would be cancelled in accordance to their cancellation policy which means there would not be a refund of any kind. I contacted Airbnb and they were able to assist me. 
Do yourself a favor and do not stay here unless you want to be scammed and then spend the night with roaches."

There is a wonderful back patio with white lights that is perfect for enjoying a glass of wine and relaxing. The kitchen was well stocked with necessities, and there were even some toiletries stocked in the bathroom. If you love the charm of older cottages but need modern updates this place is perfect. 

The only thing that could possibly be a problem for some travelers is the stairs. The property is located on the hillside between two streets, so you have to go up or down 3-4 flights of concrete stairs with no handrails. My sister and I are both active and enjoyed the workout, but my parents who are both in their 60's came to visit and had a really hard time. They are healthy but not active so it really winded them. However for an active person, it's great!"

The place is situated just some min walk from the walk of fame, in a really quiet place of Los Ángeles. You have everything you want in there: tv, a kitchen really well equiped, a small balcony where you can have your breakfast... So if you go for a couple of days, you will feel as at home!

We just found one problem. And was with the cleaning. We saw the sheets of the beds a little bit dirty when we arrived... We don´t know yet if it was a problem of organization with the people that were checking out before and our arrival.

But despite of this thing, I highly recommend Denise´s apartment in Hollywood"

They were always there to answer questions and offer recommendations. Rosa's place is in a great location with the ability to walk to many places. I felt safe while walking around town even at night. The city view is amazing. I was expecting more noise because of it being on the street side except that was not the case. It was quiet at all hours so you could get a good night sleep. Now, let's talk about that good night sleep. That mattress is amazing. It was so comfortable to the point that I would have preferred to stay in bed sleeping during my entire stay.  Overall the condo was perfect. The kitchen had everything you needed if you prefer to cook. Bathroom was stocked with enough towels, toilet paper and toiletries. She even had beach towels. Love that she offered Netflix and a comfy couch that actually pulls out to make anther bed. I did not use it as a bed so can't review but I'm sure its great. The separate balconies for the living room and bedroom are great to just calm down while looking at the city lights or stars. Additional perks are the indoor parking space and the fact that the condo has a washer and dryer. Much needed perks for any person traveling. Overall I would highly recommend Rosa's place. I can't wait to visit again."

"1216671",23292338,316192557,"2018-08-30",2837291,"Natalie","Suzan is a very zealous host and I cannot complain that the room was not accurately described in the listing but I do think it's lack of privacy is down played a little. I think personally I am a very private person and I did not feel that the room nor the host allowed for me to have much privacy during my stay, a lot of door knocking at all times of the day, which made me feel a little uncomfortable. There was also a lot of other guests in the house at the same time which made the flat very noisy and very populated which didn't help either. One of the other guests also kept, by mistake, walking into my room at night because he had stayed in that room previously and clearly kept forgetting he had a different room now- I was sympathetic to the mistake but it certainly made sleeping a little difficult in the end. The air mattress was comfortable and the clothes hanger was sufficient. One small towel was provided throughout the stay. There is a large archway overlooking the hallway which was for the most part covered but actually doesn't stop any noise. Suzan did provide ear plugs which did help a little but I am such a light sleeper. There were also no curtains over the windows which made the room seem very light during the night and also very exposed. Also anything I wanted to have out needed to sit in the trays provided and I had to be very careful about my things touching the furniture in the room. Also there was a rule about no food or drink in the rooms, which is fine and I wanted to respect the hosts requests but it did mean I ended up having to eat out a lot as I didn't feel comfortable enough to really cook and eat in the communal areas with so many people always around. You do have to pay to use the washer/ dryer and I was asked by the host to clean the shower myself after every use despite paying a cleaning fee. Suzan was extremely friendly and was very kind to let me check out a little later than listed as she had no one staying in the room that day and I had a later flight which I hugely appreciated. If you are someone who wants a super friendly host and can sleep through anything then this place would definitely suit you. For me as a very private person and someone who can only sleep well when I am 100% comfortable and for the money I paid I would expect a little more privacy but my options were limited with my last minute booking in the height of summer. As a last minute thing it did the job and I appreciated Suzan's help in accommodating me."

The location is great, walking distance from Main St and Abbot Kinney - and well located in driving distance to any other spots in LA you would want to visit. If walking around locally be prepared to conquer the small hill the apartment is situated on. While this allows for some amazing views, it does leave you breathless after pushing a stroller back up (and/or are 7 months pregnant like I was during our visit) - not a deterrent but something to keep in mind! 
Mani was an excellent host, she made us feel very welcome and was just a call/txt away if we needed anything! We would definitely recommend her place to anyone looking to plan a trip to the Venice/Santa Monica area!!"

It was super clutch to have a washer and dryer, and the check-out checklist was very minimal, which I appreciated (wash dishes only).

If you're arty, kind, and like access to a free bike, Buddy's place can't be beat. 

Without doubt, I'll be a return customer. "

Buddy was friendly and very helpful with many suggestions for things to do and places to eat. We loved using his bikes to bike down to Venice beach, it was a real bonus as driving in LA gets tiresome.
Our room was simple but still had Buddy's artistic touch. The building shows it's age if you look closely, but everything was kept very clean so we didn't feel uncomfortable at any point.

My bathroom had a gorgeous Mexican ceramic sink and a large tub with the largest shower head I've even seen.   Plenty of hot water; the A/C in the private attached room and the bedroom ceiling fan kept me cool.   I enjoyed 2 of the 4 fresh fruit and a good cup of herbal tea.   The welcome wine--delicious white sparkling wine--was a superb treat.   There are several excellent restaurants and Trader Joe's market very close.   Freeway access (either the 2 or 110) is convenient.  Her lovely, quiet garden in the back, adjacent to the guest room, is perfect for relaxing or reading.

If you want to feel like an A-List Celebrity, then this very glamorous home with beautiful architecture, decor and killer views will get you there. From the moment you pull up, you know you are part of something special. 

Key feature: wall-to-wall and ceiling-to-floor windows. You can see hiking trails and hills on one side, beautiful green mature trees below you, and city scape and mountains in the far distance. The best part of the stay was finding excuses not to go out and just hanging out with friends in the spacious common areas, enjoying the view. The home was very clean and so roomy. The bathrooms were gorgeous and the entire home had a great and roomy layout. Everyone was very happy with their beds, mattresses were very comfortable and the sheets and towels were clean and soft. 

Host Amber and Melody are perfect and both are such sweet people! 
Melody, who lives in a different home downstairs, was available for questions and gave us space to enjoy. The neighborhood is in a great part of town which is very safe area. The city has and is nearby to several walkable districts with so many restaurants, bars, shoppings etc. It is perfectly situated for a perfect LA and Valley experience, since most key parts of town were reachable easily and quickly from there. 

We absolutely loved seeing the acting memorabilia of the original home-owner. Bring your script and tap into your acting lessons, as you definitely will feel inspired here by the old Hollywood magic.

O apto fica junto a várias outras unidades no quintal da propriedade, que tem uma decoração over e muito excêntrica. 
O ponto positivo é que a anfitriã disponibiliza bicicletas para os hóspedes e é realmente delicioso explorar a região dessa forma. Mas apenas durante o dia. À noite os bares e restaurantes fecham cedo e a região de Venice fica um pouco abandonada."

Attempted to wash & dry linen but dryer took longer than most dryers to dry, so we went to a near by Ross to purchase sheets & towels. Bathrooms have black mold in grout, back bathroom tub was clogged leaving us to stand in water while we showered.

This is also the first place I’ve stayed at in Whittier where I never had a problem finding parking. Once, while staying at another Airbnb, I spent at least 20 minutes driving around the neighborhood, looking for a place where I could parallel park. Here, you just pull into the driveway. It’s such a relief to know that I can stay out ‘till 11, or leave to get dinner, and I won’t have to worry about being able to find a parking spot when I get back.

For this trip, I looked for places from Whittier to Rosemead. Every other listing seemed to either have an issue with bugs, or parking, or a lack of amenities, but Arlene’s place is great.

I’ve been using Airbnb for a few years now, and she’s the best host I’ve had. Tremendously considerate, attentive, and kind. I highly recommend staying here."

The outdoor space is charming as well and our dog enjoyed having a place to roam/lay out in the sun. Richard went above and beyond in leaving complimentary breakfast goodies, wine, fresh fruit and water for us. Everything was exactly as described and clean. Charming, safe neighborhood. The only thing I'd recommend is to install AC or provide some fans, but I believe Richard is putting AC in this summer :) 

Highly recommend!"

A well-equipped kitchen and large modern dining room table  made possible a number of memorable family meals.  Both the table and the deck, as well as the master bedroom, overlook the Valley and mountains, making for a relaxing and scenic experience.  The owner left us a three-page note and stopped by, making sure everything was working and that we were happy.  House generally worked well for three couples, but the third couple had to use one of the other en-suite bathrooms in order to shower, and both shower doors had some issues.  Third bed in room beyond laundry room was not ideal due to fold-out structure and bar in mattress.  Plenty of towels and good quality bed linens.  Overall, house was in excellent condition.  We especially appreciated personal touches, including bottle of wine left for us.  It truly felt like a home away from home!  Super convenient location and lovely neighborhood too."

If you want to avoid these problems I advise you to take a picture of everything while you stay here. Also be prepared and aware that the host enters the house without telling you or even giving you a call. So he will violate your privacy. Lastly THIS IS NOT A HOUSE!!!!!  I repeat THIS IS NOT A HOUSE!!!! This is a Duplex you share the place with another occupancy down stairs. Will not/would not  be recommending to others."

If you have any questions about the area I am confident they can assist you. The room is cozy and private, and you can come and go easily without disturbing the hosts. Just do watch out, the private bathroom is open concept, and not screened off from the bedroom part of the room. In my case, traveling alone, this was not an issue, but I imagine this could be bothersome for those traveling together. 

All in all, great listing, great location, and I would certainly stay here again and recommend it to others."

It was super clean, comfortable (love the cosy rug!) and I even had my own little patio to soak up some sunshine! The location is also perfect, in walking distance to Sunset and Hollywood Boulevard, Runyon Canyon and, if you decide not to walk, there is also ample street parking. Francine herself was a great host, she welcomed me personally and showed me around and gave some great recommendations and also made sure to send me off even though it was freakishly early - thank you so much for that! I would totally recommend this, as it is perfect for any solo traveller :)"

We loved her Awesome home in Pacific Palisades overlooking the Pacific in a lovely, very safe and quiet neighborhood.  Her house is so unique, beautiful, spacious and comfortable.  The living room picture windows have glorious views of the hills and ocean in addition to great furnishings and art.  Our group of 5 used the wonderful kitchen to prepare several meals while we were there.  There was everything we needed.  The dining room is amazing with a huge table and 8 chairs and more art.  The beds were very comfortable and the location is perfect.  We were there to spend time at the beach, go to great restaurants especially in Malibu and visit The Getty, The Broad, and LACMA.  Very easy getting on the fast routes to downtown especially.

We'll be back.  We loved our experience with Anne and her fabulous property."

He was so responsive via text, which made it super easy to coordinate check in and to make plans for how we were going to make the space work for our 9 month old.

The space was really perfect for our family trip :) Downtown Monrovia is close by and is super cute and convenient for restaurants, parks or just going for a stroll. The immediate neighborhood around his place feels so quaint, quiet and peaceful. Having a full kitchen and separate bedroom / living room makes it so much nicer traveling with an infant.  We could still hang out in the living room while the baby slept.

Brian I loved the surprise of all the extra amenities.  There were packaged toothbrushes, and even a packaged set of nail clippers and a first aid kit if you needed it!  As someone who almost always forgets something when they pack, it just seemed so thoughtful.

We loved the bookshelf of books as well. My husband really got into reading one of them and ended up buying the ebook for the trip home. 

Thank you so much Brian! We will be back!"

The west wing of the house is perfect for a vacation, a short- and also a long-term stay. The neighborhood is super safe and the dog (Addie May) is not only super old but also super cute and not dangerous at all, so no need to worry! The apartment is clean, the furniture and the décor are carefully selected and arranged and a lot of effort has been put into the details! The equipment is fully functional and all technology, including the wifi, work perfectly. The garden is beautiful, Corinne and Mike even grow their own veggies. There is also a pool available on the property for those who like to cool themselves off during summertime. There is also parking space available on the property for those deciding to rent a vehicle or come by car. We are exchange students from Germany and did not have a clue ""how things work down here"" and were happy to receive some really good advice from Corinne and Mike! I honestly don't know what we would have done without these two amazing hosts, not only did they care for our well-being and treated us like their own children, they even helped us moving into our new apartment!!! I have no words to express how grateful I am for what Corinne and Mike did for us! They did more than anyone could have ever imagined to make our stay at their airbnb and our life in the States after our stay in the West Wing as memorable as possible. If anyone of their family members decides to come to Germany I am more than happy to assist with their trip! God bless them!"

On the day I arrived at Kim's, I used one of her 2 bikes and rode to Manhattan and Hermosa beaches. Manhattan and Hermosa are pretty far away, so when I realized I was too tired to ride back home, Kim kindly offered to pick me up (about a 20 min drive). The next day I went to Venice and Santa Monica beaches. Those are MUCH closer. Kim drove me to the airport and I was happy with my stay at her house. The room was very clean and the bed was very comfy. Kim had some breakfast items to eat as well. If I ever return to LA, I will be sure to stay with her! Thank you Kim!! "

The parking spot, electronic entry, full kitchen were great (she has kept the place well stocked, we were relieved to have sugar, tea etc. which we don't always expect). Sandra and her husband were quick in communication and gracious (we ran over a few minutes at checkout). It is fairly spacious. The place is sparingly furnished, with minimal linens and towels (at least for a family of four like us). We were not impressed by the cleanliness - there was a lot of dust (if you have asthma etc you might rethink this - the furnace filter/vent doesn't look like it's ever been cleaned), a big cobweb on the bedroom (bottom corner too, not ceiling - hard to miss in vacuuming), the fridge top was very dirty, etc. With a hefty cleaning fee, this is especially bad. While the convenience of location was very welcome, we likely won't stay here again."

The decorations and furniture were beautiful, and the accommodations were great!  It's located close to Universal Studios, Hollywood, Ventura Blvd, and several other LA area attractions.  Danny (the owner) was also an amazing host.  During our stay, the sensors were beeping (typically this happens when the batteries run low), and he came over that night to make sure that they were fixed and everything was working properly.  This was all in an effort to make us feel safe and well taken care of.  

I would recommend this amazing house because of the space, the location and the fact that Danny is a very attentive and accommodating host!  We would definitely stay again in the future!"

I've never had a such friendly host like him.
His house is clean, quiet and orderly.
He was so helpful, even before my stay. He called me in Brazil to arrange everything and to ask if I would need anything more than his house. By that time he gave some tips for getting around LA better.
When we first met, he took me for a ride around LA e we unbelievably went for a hiking close to his place. After that we hang out couples time since he was still into showing me local lifestyle.
I highly recommend Saul as a host. More than that, as a friend to keep in touch after leaving LA.

We met Joseph and Primila briefly and stayed in the rooms upstairs. We found the Airbnb centrally located, easily accessed and the two sinks and showers bathroom also very convenient."
"1495246",35166323,471577278,"2019-06-17",19710795,"Sam","I cannot recommend this listing to anyone. While the neighborhood as a whole is quite lovely, I cannot say the same about this building. The building in this listing is a former senior-housing center turned into a ""budget motel"" with questionable legality, with ""Pablo's listing"" as one of the units. After cleaning fees, taxes, etc, it is not significantly cheaper than other listings, yet it tries to use price as the main reason things are ""not luxury"". 

The building is littered with salvaged (hopefully not stolen...) bikes and scooters from scooter-share companies in various stages of dismantling. The entrances to the building are not secure (at least 2 of the stairwells did not have doorknob or lock). While we thankfully did not have an incident regarding our safety, we did not feel safe in this listing. 

As a bonus, we found a cockroach in the common area of this building.

Pablo is relatively uncommunicative and had a 1-day delay on any messages he actually answers (He answered 1 to 2 of 4 questions I asked him). He'll refer you to the front desk for all questions, and the front desk didn't always have people (our success rate was about 30%). 

The listing showed ""Free Parking on Premises"" as an amenity when we booked, but it's really $10/day. It's a whole new definition of ""free"". That might've been removed now that I brought it to their attention.

Inside the bathroom of the unit, if you close the bathroom door from the inside, you will be unable to get out without pushing this tiny little lever with your fingernail. It's not a normal doorknob... it's very possible to get stuck inside. We also saw some mold in the bathroom, and we found two cockroaches in the bathroom on our last day for good measure.

The blinds are missing 3 panels, so the bedroom portion of the studio has no privacy from outside. The wifi password is at the front desk, so you need to hope that someone's there to give it to you.

We couldn't tell, but there were either stains or bleach marks on the bedsheets. We hope the rest of the bed was clean, but we really couldn't tell. 

Everything that met expectations: studio door lock, plumbing, electricity, air conditioning, fridge, wifi (after we finally got the password), chairs, and bed. (Didn't use TV, microwave, or sofa). 

If it was significantly cheaper and you're willing to take on these risks, maybe it could be a good deal. However, it's not for me. We completely regret our decision to book this listing with Pablo, and this goes down as our worst Airbnb experience to date."

Jooles has brilliant taste.  Her interior is comfortable and pleasing and the outside space is complete with pergola, string lights, and a leisurely dining area.

A great bonus was a swimming pool inside the yard, where one can enjoy on sunny day. And I definitely liked the location close to Santa Monica Blvrd and luxurious Rodeo Drive. 
Just a note, since it may be relevant for some travelers: if you need a fully equipped kitchen - make sure to discuss it with Sam before you arrive. 
I'm definitely coming back to that place next time I'm in LA!"

Love the simple & modern decor, and the cozy backyard with a small garden! The room w/ private bath has everything we needed to feel at home, especially with good internet connection and a nice TV selection for unwinding at night. This room was perfect for us to attend a conference near Burbank airport, but still close to I-5 so we can quickly access another city nearby. It's within walking distance from a bakery/cafe, convenience store, and was quite and felt safe at night. Wish we had a little more time to visit Griffith Park!

Second, in communicating that I'll be bringing my dog, Stacy prepped for our arrival with a dog bed (he preferred it over the one I brought from home), a food and water bowl, and treats! I'm addition, my dog had use of a private, secure yard to do his business that was easily accessible via an installed doggy dog. Human amenities was equally thoughtful like the refillable Brita pitcher, a fully decked out kitchen, a comfortable bed and toiletries in the bathroom in case I forgot something.

The location is in a nice spot at Van Nuys in a short UBER distance to Hollywood Boulevard, Griffith Observatory, and Universal. Furthermore, in case you want to have a break from exploring LA, there are some restaurants and a movie theater within a walking distance (~0.6 miles).

Regarding the noise from gym users that the description mentions, I should say that you should be really sensitive to noise in order for it to be a problem. For us, the noise was almost inexistent. "

The location is stellar, walking to Santa Monica Blvd, the Abbey, Mickey's...you can't beat the location.  If you are worried about parking, don't fret as Jeffrey provides a pass and just in case there are meters close to the house.
Besides the location, we were very happy with the spaciousness, high ceilings and unique character and charm of Jeffrey's apartment.  Garden setting, patio, quiet (Website hidden by Airbnb) was an absolutely lovely location and building to stay in.
Our expectations for cleanliness were met as well.  We all felt it important to stay in a clean place and Jeffrey's place did just that.
My only suggestion would be to provide more information about check in.  We had a small delay at check in and weren't able to get in touch with Jeffrey as soon as we had hoped.  When we called Airbnb, Jeffrey was able to get in touch with us.  Jeffrey also called the next day to apologize for the delay and that was much appreciated.  
Things can get busy so I don't think that should detract from the great stay we had.  If you need to check in right at 3pm, just make sure you get all the information so you have no delays.
Overall we had  A GREAT STAY and would readily book again!"

The cottage has a modern decor with all the amenities. A welcome basket is provided filled with goodies.  Bath products are even provided. The kitchen has dinnerware and everything one needs to cook. Also, there is a small outside BBQ.

The property has a beautiful garden and lovely outside sitting areas. One feels very safe in the neighborhood. 

Paul and Lisa are very friendly. They immediately responded whenever we had a question.  They respect one’s privacy. 

Previously, my husband had never stayed at an AirBnB.  He can be a real pain when it comes to travel lodgings. Initially, he was concerned because of the cottage’s location on the property. However, he was so impressed during our first stay that he insisted that we stay at Paul’s place on our recent trip. If we ever return to LA, it will be the only place that we will stay and I recommend it to my friends if they visit LA."

The location was amazing, walking distance to the Grove, Fairfax, Melrose... you’re really in the heart of Hollywood. Although everything was easy to get to, the parking was a nightmare. There was no parking stall for the unit, so everything was street parking, 1hr for $1. Not too bad but over the course of a couple days we did end up spending quite a bit of money to park our car near the area during our stay. The apartment was a little bit odd, older building of course. Floors were creaky, I was unsure of a thermometer so It was pretty cold in there for my opinion. The unit itself is on ground level, and is right at the entrance of the building. You can hear every noise, and step that goes on. Sheets were comfy, everything was cleaned for us before hand, he provided us with a bunch of water bottles which was nice! I would recommend Arthur for anyone who won’t be staying in LA for too long, and not planning to have a rent a car! :)

The barn area has goats (of course), dogs, chickens, pigs, and a rescued donkey. The goats are super friendly. We spent hours hanging out with them and tried milking Apple, the queen goat. Not as easy as we thought. But Gloria is there to walk you through it and save the day.
The Airstream is as described in the overview. Just what we expected.
The hosts are amazing. You interact with them as little or as much as you'd like.

It is spacious and comfortable in a great location. 3 comfortable double beds (3rd bed is a little smaller but still a double) and two contemporary bathrooms. We only stayed one night so didn't eat in at all but easily could have - there was a nice big table to sit around, and the kitchen looked good.

The location is pretty central but I would say it's still driving distance to most places we wanted to visit. We had a hire car so this was no problem - or otherwise I'm sure ubers would have been fine.

We found on-street parking with no problem just outside the flat although be careful - we got a parking ticket for parking in the wrong direction to the traffic. Had no idea this wasn't allowed!

Really good communication from Gifford & Minnie and very easy checking in and out. They also left out their own guide of things to do and places to eat in the area which was really useful."

First of all, Joseph is a superhost. Communicates and responds very well to your emails/questions. Very enthousiastic and helpful guy. We asked for a weighting scale to weight our suitcases and in 2 minutes the weighting scale was there as Joseph lives next to the appartment.

The location is very close to the the airport (10 minutes) and 5 minutes from the 105 Freeway and I-405. You might hear and see airplanes take-off or land. But Joseph had earplugs ready in case you needed it. Yes, pink ones for the ladies !! It didn't bother us as we were gone during the day and came back late in the evening (less air traffic at night).

Very nice bed and bathroom with shower. Even shower supplies and more then enough towels were there. Wifi is great as we were able do to video calling with our home in Europe. Cable TV is available. You can park your car in front of the garage. 

We defenitely would come back here next time. Thanks Joseph !"

There are so many shops, restaurants and bus lines that are incredibly close that the location is hard to beat. It's on a busy road and the window faces it so be prepared to have trouble falling asleep, to wake up in the middle of the night, and to be woken up extremely early.

I think she was a little surprised at the mess and noise and tried to remedy the situation. We dealt with the dust and dirt and ended up having a lovely weekend."

However, Inglewood doesn't give off the safety vibe, and the street the house is on feels cramped. Even so, there is secure parking, so you don't have to worry about parking on the street! 

It's very close to the Forum, so perfect for concerts. It's also close to LAX, and right under the flight path so you hear planes flying close over head as they land and takeoff (but you can't really hear it as much from the room).

But all the noise from the bar made our stay very stressful until 2am. Even worse is “the woofer sound” from 10pm to 2am every night. It strongly shakes the windows and floors. You are right above the bar and feel every vibration. Its my fault even booking this noisy place (from 10pm to 2am) after read reviews from others. So I won’t complain, ‘cause I know it has nothing to do with Ross or this apartment. I recommend this place for those young travelers sleeping late, hopping clubs and bars near downtown every night feeling night life in DTLA, then it’s wonderful place for you. DTLA is not like other major city downtown. In the night, it is full of homeless on the street and definitely not a good or safe place for family tourist to stay. "

It is in such a great location, they have bikes available that we used to bike to the beach and it was only a 10 minute bike ride and really fun!! Jan was so so helpful getting us things we needed at a short notice even late at night! They were always so kind whenever we would see them! Although we had an amazing stay, I would like to leave a few suggestions that we noticed while being here. Not complaints in the slightest. Around the hot tub and sitting area there are a lot of dead leaf shedding from the above tree, which is understandable, she tree isn’t going anywhere and I can only imagine how difficult it would be to keep up with it. However it just made the outside feel a little more dirty and we didn’t really want to sit out there. We almost wish we had a broom just to do a quick sweep. We had an incident where we needed a new fitted sheet and Jan was so kind to bring us one late at night, it would be nice and convenient if there were extra sheets, bath and beach towels, and pillow cases in the studio. Lastly and this is probably me just being picky, it does feel quite dark in the studio, there aren’t many windows which is totally fine, we weren’t here most of the time anyways, I LOVE light. I think it would really brighten the place up with some daylight light bulbs rather than yellow light, as well as maybe the walls being painted white. There were also quite a few spiders in the living space. A huge spider had made a web that i was inches away from walking into. This is definitely me being picky in what I love and prefer. Don’t let my suggestions turn you away. This studio exceeded our expectations from the photos online. Such a great location, hosts, and it has everything you will need for being a small studio! We enjoyed every second of our stay and if we come back to long beach again we may stay somewhere else just for more space!"

also am 1. Tag wo wir angekommen waren war Shelley nicht da und ihr Ehemann wollte von uns gleich die 400$ Cleaning Gebühren, naja gut wir haben ihn dann auch das Geld gleich gegeben. Leider mussten wir schon nach einer Woche nachause obwohl wir für einen Monat gebucht hatten. Die Cleaning Gebühren für einen Monat waren 400 $ richtig aber, da wir ja nur eine Woche geblieben sind müssten sie uns eigentlich 350$ wieder zurück geben müssen anstatt desen haben wir 65$  Dollar.
Sehr Gastfreundlich und sehr nett fanden wir das natürlich nicht, aber das ist halt jetzt so. Das Gasthaus ist ansich ganz okey aber ohne Auto ist man wie im nirgendwo. Hollywood ist aber sehr schön war ein tolles Erlebniss. Mehr über Shelley und Ihrem Haus möchte ich nicht sagen es passt schon. Wir sind halt sehr entäuscht von ihrem verhalten  :( !!

Liebe Grüße Aynur und Efkan

George's place was a perfect home base for our trip to LA and gave us easy access to the major highways to get to anywhere else as quickly as possible. The apartment was great and we had no complaints other than some slight miscommunication about checking in, which George solved quickly.

All in all, highly recommend staying here. The free snacks were a nice touch!"

A few downsides were unfortunate though.  The room was not ready at the 3pm check-in time, and the bathroom had some issues with slow drainage in the sink and bathtub.  Silvio was very pleasant during communication, but did leave us hanging when we asked about help regarding luggage storage, asking about either secure luggage storage prior to check-in or the possibility of early check in.  It would have been totally fine if neither were options at this Airbnb, but he did not answer our question with several prompts.

Kinte is a lovely man and also met his mother since she was staying over - very sweet and charming people.

Beautiful, quiet, suburban neighborhood close a number of cafes, restaurants, and shops. Very near to Little Ethiopia.

Sadly is was cold and with no heating made the first 3 days of our stay pretty miserable. We finally went out to buy a heater as the ones promised to us did not materialize until our very last night.  I would imagine that this is a better summer house than winter so I would advise you checking on the heating situation before booking. It's also a shame that they do not have a washing machine and dryer considering all of the plumbing is there. Another thing to bear in mind is that the fuses blew a couple of times. Once we located the fuse box this wasn't a problem but grappling around in the middle of the night was not much fun, especially as it is outside. Maybe this is why they don't have heating and laundry?"

When i walked in, the house reeked of weed and I'm not a smoker. I didnt know which way to go in the house and had to call Katarina to ask for my room details and all as she had not given me any heads up. It turned out to be a hostel type of accommodation which i don't mind but would have appreciated Katarina letting me know about it. She had advertised it just as a room not a shared room of 6 and smoking house. Otherwise the location is great, there's a shopping centre down the road, a 99c store, metro line and lots of cafes & restaurants. If ever i have to visit LA again, i wouldn't stay there."

Location- Right on Hollywood Boulevard and there are a lot of things close to the apartment. 
Checkin/checkout process- very easy and convenient with the lockbox. 
Parking- lot right across the street. 

Cons:
The A/C was not working during our visit so we opened the windows to get some colder air into the room. There is a nightclub right under the building so it was very noisy with the windows open. Also, the shower did not get warm at all."

Note that the patio isn´t sunny. 

We were also a bit surprised that we were asked to document older stains on the sheets and  towels, otherwise we would be charged for the old stains. This made our stay a bit uncomfortable since we were afraid to make any mess anywhere. Easily there will be some stains on towels and sheets even if you are super tidy. When we told Seph that we made some small stains of mascara on the towels we were asked to remove them ourselves with make up remover.  

Otherwise we would recommend the area and Steph´s lovely house."

I also messaged Keith to inform him his shower handle is broken. I had to turn the handle several times tirelessly just to get the water on, then the water was cold. I couldn’t adjust the temp because the handle was broken and if I turned the handle a certain way, my shower probably would’ve turned off completely. It was a hit or miss for me to even get the shower on! Both of the bathrooms became to flood. I informed him of this issue twice and no response. The floor mats were so soiled I couldn’t undress or get ready in the bathroom. This made me uncomfortable since I would rather change in private, not in the living room. After 2 cold showers, my 3rd shower I couldn’t even take because I couldn’t get the handle to grip the knob to turn the water on. Since I never heard from Keith my ENTIRE stay, I felt very uncomfortable and unsafe in the apt. I didn’t want to inform Airbnb until I left because I didn’t want any confrontation since I was traveling alone. I wish Keith had acknowledged that he knew I was there or else I wouldn’t have felt like he or another guest could walk right in. This would have made me feel more comfortable. Every time  I walked back into the apartment I would check everywhere to make sure no one was there. When I had to undress and dress in the living room, I felt like I was being watched. The whole time I wondered if he knew I was there and would he m or someone else walk in the apt unknowingly.  I am so disappointed and glad I am back home safe. I also texted Keith with the number provided on the itinerary and still no response."

the kitchen counter and sink is higher than standard...but he owners have told me that they are purchasing a one-step platform for easier use by those who are ""on the short side""

He allowed us to check in a bit earlier than expected due to our flight coming in a bit earlier and personally walked us through the place and all the aspects of it. He left a ha du guide for us to follow of the local places to visit. This is a return trip for us and we were unaware of some of the new kings in the area. He allowed us the use of bikes - which saved on rentals - and even replaced on of the bikes that had a flat. He really went out of his way to make us feel welcome. 

We’d be happy to return to his place anytime we visit Redondo or Manhattan Beach."

I was dubious about this arrangement at first as it was my first experience with airbnb and also with living with someone else.  I was afraid it might be awkward.  Not at all!  The house is large so it's easy to have as much private time and space as you want but Bryce is also extremely friendly and full of knowledge and suggestions about the area.  The house is large, airy, and so clean.  Bathroom is also large, pristine, and Bryce even provides toiletries.  Everything you need is within driving or walking distance but even though you are technically in LA, the house is on a quiet dead end street, and the backyard/pool area is a lush garden with trees, bushes, and flowers.  It's like there's no neighbors at all and you're in your own private oasis.  Spent my last few days sunbathing and enjoying the pool all to myself.  I didn't want to leave and hope to return next winter."

The garden outside is so cute, and so nice to have a space to relax outside.   The house itself is beautiful, everything is so new and beautifully done.   We loved that the house had a washing machine as we were there for a week and didn't have to pack so many clothes.    The location is perfect - we could walk to all of the shops/restaurants in both Venice and Santa Monica.   Another huge bonus was having a space to park as it can be difficult finding parking on the street at times.
Julie was so accommodating and responsive during our visit.   We had such a wonderful vacation and we can hardly wait to come back :)   "

The apartment is as described and is in a really cool part of town. Sunset Blvd with some great restaurants and shops is a quick 10min walk from there. There is also a Farmer's Market on Fridays nearby, that we loved. 

Nicole was super helpful in coordinating everything from afar. She kept in touch throughout our stay, making sure we were well-taken of, and had her friends drop off anything we needed. Great host, truly!

The only thing that I'd warn about is street parking. We managed to find it every night we got there (sometimes a few blocks away, but a walk will do you good! :)). However, it's parallel-parking up the hill, so if you're not very familiar with that (I wasn't), it can be a challenge. One I was happy to face, and conquer :), but worth noting. "

The place was no where close to being clean, and it felt like an old dirty motel. It’s hard to believe that the blood stain on bed could’ve been missed if the sheet had been changed or properly cleaned. Parking was not easy as well. It was almost always unavailable throughout the day. We ended up paying for the parking on the other street. We had three night reservation but we checked out after one night, because it was very uncomfortable. It was our mistake overlooking the negative reviews before booking. I would not recommend this place!"

The apartment is gorgeous, it's the perfect size for two people and makes for a thoroughly relaxing experience; we felt totally secure and at home. In terms of location, Silverlake Bvd is less than 5minutes up the street, and from there we were able to take the bus to Hollywood and Union Station with ease. Silverlake has a really laid back atmosphere and is seemingly quite hip, but simultaneously feels safe and friendly. Kara and Oren's is the ideal arrangement and we highly recommend it!"

It was so good to be able to spend only leisurely time in sweet resting time which greeted after a long time.
Beaches and cafes that are not far away have also contributed to the fun of the house.
It is not easy to find parking spaces that can be parked at night, but it was a bit small compared to the charm of this house. I would like to go back to this house again without worrying if I come back to Long Beach again"

The place itself was quiet and private, but I was not made aware that there would be other guest on site during my stay. As I was using the pool, two other house guest joined(they were not a bother), it was just a bit of surprise when I thought it was a private setting. The Airbnb was very cute and cozy.

The apartment was spacious and looked exactly like the pictures, it was really clean when we arrived and all the sheets, towles, etc. were already available. Also the living room had a apple TV which we really enjoyed. The kitchen was decent and there were also washing and drying machines downstairs near the parking (they're public coin machines). The available parking spot was a plus as we were renting a car. The location was fantastic, because it's located in a very quiet neighborhood and there were several convenience stores located minutes drive from the apartment. As for the downsides, the rooms didn't have AC, there is only 1 AC unit located in the center of the apartment (outside the rooms) but it didn't bother us too much, also the room curtains was bad as it didn't block the lights at all (This was solved by the host by bringing us new ones). Speaking of the host, he was really great and friendly, he always communicated with us asking if everything was ok and he helped us solve the problems we faced (like the curtains situation).

I would definitely recommend this apartment if you're staying in LA."

LA is not very pedestrian-friendly, so staying in one of it's more walkable neighbourhoods was an advantage - Melrose a few blocks south, Santa Monica a few blocks north, able to walk to the WeHo Halloween Carnaval. The studio was nicely designed, bright, felt safe, and quiet. Kitchen was generally well-appointed, although didn't have a kettle. Matthew is straightforward and direct to deal with, but a bit of extra local knowledge would've been appreciated - we had no reason to expect the Carnaval, so had to park our car eight streets away when we returned from the beach that evening. But in short, a good Airbnb experience."

You could see Griffith Observatory from the living room windows just to give you an idea of where it is. 

We had a couple of issues with a few things. First, the AC didn’t work at all. We out a request in with the hosts and they said they would send a tech. Not sure if anyone went, but the AC was stuck at 76 for 5 straight days and actually got hotter during peak sunlight. With the humidity in LA, it was a big deal. The apartment was moist everywhere you touched.. kind of uncomfortable. 

Overall it was a solid stay."

I did not expect a fancy place so my standards were not high. I may not have understood the property as there were common areas but no one else was there when we were. Not knowing was a strange experience but I could have asked. The floor looked clean but walking barefoot revealed that the flors were really dirty.  Maybe fine dust blows in the screens? The bedroom did not smell fresh. The host was very responsive to questions. Check in, parking, location were all great. I do not think it is fair to be charged a cleaning fee when the place did not seem to have been cleaned."

It truly looks just like the photos and is as spotlessly clean as others have mentioned. She had plenty of towels; the beds had  memory foam mattresses and were very comfortable. She had coffee, tea, sugar and creamer available at the little ""coffee station"" in the kitchen.  FYI she has no dishwasher but that was not an issue for us. The washer/dryer is located in a separate room outside the back kitchen door and was really nice to have. The location was great-just a few miles from the highways and a short drive to the red line metro which itself is only 2 stops from Hollywood.  Since my daughter was actually moving to La,  she had her car shipped there and It was so nice to have a driveway that fit 2 cars. It was super convenient to restaurants and grocery stores. We never saw Ani but she was very easy to reach and super responsive.  I have not one complaint and we really can't imagine staying anywhere else when we come back to visit our daughter.

The towels were amazingly soft, and the shower was awesome. There were a few downsides though, one of which was pretty significant. First, the Jacuzzi was not heated, which was a bummer, as we were hoping to soak after a chilly (for LA standards) week. There were also instructions inside saying not to turn the Jacuzzi heat on, because it is expensive, and we would be charged for it. The other frustrating thing was trying to figure out how to work the lights. It shouldn't be a difficult thing, but there were tons of switches that seemed to do nothing, and the dimmers were all the way down on the ones that did. The switches could certainly benefit from some labels."

Lisa and Joe are very welcoming and the rooms are comfortable with shared bathrooms and good shower or bath.  Bed is a big double not king but soft and cozy. The breakfasts are a huge plus for the traveller as I think they are the most important meal of the day when out and about. There is also a nice communal room with tea facilities and books to read and TV. They have bikes to hire at a day rate that is the same as an hour rate from elsewhere. We walked to see Venice and SM to get some exercise after the long flight from UK but the round trip was 7 miles so we were a bit knackered!! Very interesting though especially seeing all the down and outs in both VB and SM. They didn't bother us but it is sad to see so many fall into this state of existence in the US especially when the rest of our time in LA was spent in the other end of existence touring around Beverly Hills,  Bel Aire and    Hollywood. What is our lasting impression of LA - one word Traffic. Leave yourself plenty of time to get anywhere in LA; the traffic is far worse than anywhere I have been recently!! Overall a great 2 nights at Lisa and Joe's was the perfect start to our 3 week road trip of California."

I stayed for almost 3 weeks and I loved every single second!

After searching for a place to stay for over 2 weeks and browsing through well over 50 different hosts, I found Mark's place and hit the jackpot!

So if you read this it means you found his place and I just have to congratulate you! you've found the best hoast and best place to stay!

The house is big and beautiful and has its own personality :D It got that lovely Venice vibe with lots of interesting details and decorations!

I rented the big beautiful cozy bedroom on 2nd floor which included a great bathroom with everything you could possibly need! It even had a iron that was useful after my suitcase had been given a beating. The room has sliding doors out to a patio with stairs up to the sunroof!

It's close to Abbot Kinney, beaches is just a quick sunny walk and there is lots of shops on Lincoln Street which is right ""next door"".

Mark has a great personality and is a great human beeing!
He is welcoming, kind and funny and has a positive happy mind!
He is also very interesting to talk to, he has traveled a lot and has lots of stories!

His positive personality and energy makes you feel at home!

Me, Mark and his wonderful girlfriend went to the Griffith Observatory together to watch the stars and the always mesmerizing LA by night and that was a amazing experience!
I had a blast, laughed and had just a really good time!
We then went to Youghurt Land in Hollywood to indulge in some sweetness before going home to Venice.. yes I wrote home because that's what it felt like!

So Mark, thank you for everything! See you next time! :) :)"

We got up next morning,  this house is a fantasic garden and we picked lemon from the tree and saw many unknown trees.

It was easy to get in although I arrived late at night. The hosts left a bottle of water and an energy bar in the room to welcome you - overall they were very nice and welcoming.

Everything's pretty much within walking distance, but if you have a vehicle there's a parking spot right in front of the door. the beach is right at the end of the alley .  Lots of places to rent bikes and scooters . Pack a couple extra wash cloths and beach towels because  there are only two washcloths and two towels provided. There is a washing machine, just bring your own laundry detergent. It was pretty clean, but if you're really picky this might not be the place for you. Do your research on Venice Beach, there is a large homeless population that cannot be avoided  but if you enjoy people-watching you will love it. I was a little leery of the alley entryway. Definitely would not stay here by myself. Coming and going after dark was a little scary. We stayed one night on our way to Mexico and then again for two nights on our way home. Once we got to know the area a little better we were much more comfortable. overall this was an excellent place to stay."

They graciously offer a quaint guest house, tucked into the serene Los Feliz hillside. The house - a stunning example of Spanish Revival architecture - is perfectly appointed: white linen on a comfortable queen bed, a full service kitchenette (including fridge and microwave), a full bath, hanging closet and dresser. Walk outside the house and you'll find a picturesque courtyard laden with terra-cotta tile and pea gravel, and peppered with flowering plants, cactus, and succulents. At night, the courtyard is illuminated with festooned globe-lights, which uplight the natural canopy of two enormous palms; it's so quiet that you can hear the resident owls hooting. But make no mistake, this oasis is very much in the city. Los Feliz offers one of L.A.'s more charming neighborhoods, and easy access to many more, including Silver Lake, Echo Park, Hollywood, and Atwater Village. Close access to the freeway system makes this peaceful retreat entirely central. Attractions and culture abound. All in all, Eddie and Sissy offer a splendid stay in Los Angeles. "

Room comfortable and cool, with a reasonable amount of space (bigger than the pictures suggest). Cosy room with an absolutely amazing shower! Very refreshing and great after our flight. 

Short 20 minute walk to the beach, and only five dollars in an uber to get back.

Car parking was very useful.

Jo was a fantastic host and so kind and warm natured. I genuinely really enjoyed our stay and it was a wonderful start to our trip. The outdoor terrace was a great spot to have our breakfast and her dogs are lovely, cute and cuddly! Yet importantly we didn't hear them once during the evening! 

We can't rate jo high enough, she went beyond. We'd definitely also recommend the locals pizza place nearby which waa fantastic :) "

The neighborhood was quite attractive and extremely safe (I often went out on foot at night to get food, and I never felt uneasy). The room itself was very comfortable. I made good use of the desk for work, and the bed was a great size and gave me a wonderful night's sleep. At times it got a little chilly in the room, but Xin told me where to get extra blankets and he also made sure to set the heater to come on automatically when the temperature dropped.

There were so many things to appreciate about this place: I had full access to the kitchen, as well as access to the laundry machine and dryer with complimentary detergent, fragrance booster, and dryer sheets. It was situated in a great suburban location, and most importantly, Xin provided excellent service! It's tough to find all those qualities and amenities in one place, especially for such a good price. 

One thing to note is that the house has one room on the first level that is family-friendly, and sound travels very easily, so at times it got extremely loud in the house due to the screaming toddlers. Apart from that, it was a great place to stay for the 30 days I was there. I would definitely book with Xin again!"

House overall- The total interior size and outdoor space of the house is good.  The interior has some quirks.  One example is the 4 bedrooms upstairs.  One of them has no access to a bathroom upstairs as one bathroom is in the master and the other is a jack and jill between the other two bedrooms. 

Amenities in house-  This part is a bit disappointing as some parts of the house are updated and others are not.  It also lacked some basic things you would expect meaning we had to go buy some stuff. (Wine glasses, variety of cooking tools, propane tank for bbq)
There were also problems while we were there in that the Hot Tub did not work and the nice jacuzzi tub upstairs was not getting hot water.

Location- While it is not in the ""prime"" beach area it is a nice neighborhood and is convenient for access to many things.

Host- Ronni and her 2 kids could not have been nicer through the whole process with their communication and response time as issues came up but the experience had a slightly unprofessional feel. (house not quite ready at check in time, garbages full etc)  Ronni was nice enough at the end of our stay to send a text to apologize and say that she wanted to do something to make up for the problems.  However, she stopped returning texts after that which was disappointing."

from L.A. when my previous host cancelled and I booked Marq's place about five minutes after that. He was absolutely accommodating and considering that five of us were staying at his place, it was cozy, roomy, very close to the convention center and he had two parking spots for us so we didn't have to worry about street parking. I recommend him to anyone that needs to stay in the downtown L.A. area (he also has a television and balcony.)

Just remember the room number because it's easy to get lost; he lives in a giant condo complex."

I was staying for nearly three weeks doing some work in LA and the room was quiet, cool and had a desk to work on and a private bathroom, which ticked all my boxes. It is in a very good location as well - it's about a 15 minute walk to the beach and about a 25 minute walk to downtown Santa Monica, or about 3 minutes by Uber. the street itself is very quiet so I found no noise in the evening, despite having the window open every night. There is a nice Vietnamese restaurant on the corner, and Walgreens and a big supermarket are about a 5 minute walk. 

Olivier was a great host - he was very quick to respond and was very accommodating, as well as a fun and laid back guy to chat to.

Overall i'd thoroughly recommend Olivier's place to anyone visiting SM or LA that wants to be in a quieter area away from downtown."

I don’t like saying bad things about hosts but it just seems like the host doesn’t care to do any more work than is absolutely necessary to keep getting extra money for a room on Airbnb. The bathroom has no towels in it and it’s covered with ants; the shower faucet handles work in reverse: turn the handle towards the side marked cold for hot water and cold for hot water. That’s not really a problem (like not having towels) but this was never explained to me by the host. I had to spend 10 minutes in a cold miserable ant ridden shower. I’m not sure of this (because I’ve never stayed at a place where I’ve felt compelled to check) but I think there isn’t a mattress in the bedroom but that the host has guests sleeping on a box spring in the bedroom. Again, I didn’t pull up the sheets and look at the label or ask the host or her parents “Is that a box spring you have me sleeping on or did you just forget to put the mattress on the bed before I arrived?” But the bed was so stiff I can’t see how it wasn’t. Ants also got into my bags one night. Not really a problem, but again, host never told me I should prepare for ants getting into my bags. The host also advertises AC in her listing, but just about every time I turned it on someone would creep up and turn it off. It was like a game of cat and mouse. Except no one wants to play and you just feel hot, sweaty and miserable afterwards. So if you like sleeping on box springs, ants in your bags and the ac being turned off almost all the time after you’ve turned it on, come on down!"

Private garden, quiet, great bed. She made us feel so welcome by stocking some healthy snacks, fruit and beverages in the house so when we arrived, we didn't have to run out for food right away.

他們位於一個寧靜的住宅區裡面,因為他們家是向內的,所以我覺得很安靜｡
我們睡在露營車裡,不過洗澡的地方在房子裡面跟他們共用,要借廚房都可以,他們很貼心的會幫你準備毛巾跟浴巾,露營車的布置也非常的溫馨,這種可愛的布置應該是女生們都會喜歡的,因為我女朋友就非常愛｡"

One of the best Airbnb experiences I have had and I had quite a few of them.  This studio has everything you need.  The location is fantastic, right in the middle of the Westside.  It is located in a quiet residential neighborhood but still really close to a lot of great restaurants.  Most important, it is only a minute drive to the 10 freeway, which makes it quite accessible to the rest of the city.
Mark was so easy to work with.  Because of our crazy schedule, I did not get to meet Mark in person but he gave us great instructions to the studio.  He is always reachable through phone or text.  He would touch base with us via text every couple of days and make sure we have everything we need.  That's a nice touch from a landlord."

The room is very spacious, but quite dark. The room is clean, tidy and has everything you need. We couldn't find a kettle - only a coffee maker. Not a problem for my husband but as a devoted British tea drinker I was a little sad about it. The room has a large TV and having Netflix was a definite bonus with our jet lagged children.

"1288009",25207262,426685633,"2019-03-21",127738196,"Adam","We had a travel party of 9.  The house itself is nice.  The neighborhood is in a nice, quiet area and it felt safe.  There are plenty of beds here, the owner had plenty of extra pillows and blankets as well if you need those.  The backyard is spacious and peaceful, the pool is nice though it is not heated, so we didn't get to use it during mid-march.  The inside is clean and up-to-date.  The house itself is a good value.  Easy check-in instructions and the host was responsive to questions.  

Now for an AirBnB that advertises itself that 25 people can stay here.  When we arrived, we were surprised to only found 5 or 6 plates and bowls.  There were about 8 cups and a some more coffee mugs.  There was only 1 baking pan and 1 skillet/pot to cook with.  I don't understand a home that expects large parties to not have any of the cookware needed.  I did end up asking if they could bring more over, which they did, but I feel I shouldn't have to ask.  To go along with this, all the silverware is plastic and there were only forks and spoons.  We had to go purchase knives, extra paper plates, bowls and cups.  We ran out of spoons and had to go purchase more.  There wasn't any dish soap or sponges to use to wash pots/pans with, another couple items we had to purchase.  There were no hand towels to use, in the kitchen or the bathroom.  The entire house had rolls of paper towels to use, which I find very wasteful.    There were about 10 sets of bath towels to use, so plan on re-using your towel or doing laundry every night if you have a large group.  I thought there would be more, especially with a pool.  Never would hurt to have more as you can always do laundry if needed.  

Overall: It's a good, clean house that is worth it.  Just expect to purchase a lot of small, extra items or plan on going out to eat every night.  I would probably stay somewhere else next time in LA."

The house is walking distance to Union Station (ca. 30 min, if you are like me a slow walker). There is also a bus! There are several tiny shops nearby, so you can always find something to eat. Although close to Downtown, you are in a very quiet residential area, so great if you want to sleep.

However, before you book, please read Sarah's description! She and her husband live together with their toddler Sean (cute kid), 3 dogs (2 big ones) and a cat. Also, be aware that the dogs will come to you, especially Chito. There is no avoiding that :) Their house is full of character, which I personally like alot! 

So if you want a hyper-modern hotel-like experience, then this is not the place for you! However, if you are - like me - travelling for a while and you just want a cosy, home-like place to stay, then I can definitely recommend you this room! 

Both Sarah and Hannes did their utmost best to accommodate me, which I really appreciated!!! If you are into art history, Sarah has some great tips for things to visit. To be honest, I did not feel as if I was at an AirBnB, it felt more like visiting friends. I really hope I can visit them again in the future! 

I cannot emphasize enough Sarah's hospitality and I would definitely recommend this place to anyone who wants to discover LA!!!"

Unfortunately I didn’t get to meet Maggie directly, but Mom had nothing but positive things to say about her and the time she spent in this cozy cottage:

“Loved staying at the Trendy Topanga Cottage. Maggie was an angel. She was so helpful and made the most delicious breakfast and lunch. Her homemade muffins were amazing! She prepared an assortment of corn, apple, blueberry and nectarine. They were all so tasty. I would definitely stay here again. I’d give her 10/5 stars.”  _Mom"

I absolutely loved getting to know the neighborhood and walking to Antigua Coffee each day for delicious coffee and breakfast sandwiches. I found Antigua thanks to the helpful information Ethan left about the neighborhood and things to do. I also really loved the outdoor space, and treated this as my office, since I work from home much of the time. I even got WiFi out back there. There was also amazing views of downtown Los Angeles and Elysian Park from there, and very pretty sunsets. I enjoyed my time in the hammock, too. :-) "

Parking is generally difficult in Santa Monica but Saul's street had PLENTY of parking! His place is located near a street with PLENTY of great places to eat and drink. A Whole Foods was right across the street giving you the option to cook a great meal if you wanted to. The street is quiet, perfect for those looking to get away for the weekend, but still be close enough to partake in all the Santa Monica has to offer. Saul's place was better than I expected! I spent 4 days in this little oasis and can't recommend it enough. Thank you, thank you, thank you Saul!"

It was a great spot too, the bed was super comfortable, kitchen and bathroom very clean!  Cozy but not too small.  Perfect for 1-2 people.  Parking was really easy as well.

As a host, Joshua was quick to respond and extremely helpful.  It's nice to know that if something were to go awry (nothing did!) it can be quickly remedied.  Exemplary host!

I cannot recommend this place enough!"

We did not meet the hosts and I thought some sort of personal touch would have been nice, though they were nonetheless, efficient with communications at all times. 
The house did feel like a hostel with a nightly quiet time.

What was supposed to be a 3 month stay due to construction turned into a 7 month stay, all while we welcomed a new baby to our home. Yes, we lived here for 7 months with a brand new baby! That should tell you just how great the place was since we were happy to continue extending. It is of course a bit pricey but the location is fantastic and Jeff & Shannon (and property manager Aubrey) went above and beyond to make sure everything was perfect. When we arrived, there were some stains on the carpet and after alerting them they bought a brand new one for us. Anytime something was broken (freezer, washer/dryer, blinds) they sent maintenance within 24 hours and responded within minutes. At check in, the place was sparkling clean and they were incredibly accommodating of check in needs surrounding the baby. We will always hold a special place in our heart for this Airbnb, our baby's first home. Thank you!"

Shopping. highway, mall is all close by location is not far from LA. But will need a car to get around. The room was huge and I enjoyed the fact that it was all mine and carrying all the gear I had. I felt very comfortable. Lauren has 2 adorable small dogs that I barely heard from them. They are vey friendly and surprised me when I went down  to the living room and didn't even noticed them on the couch. Other than all the rules,  I would stay with Lauren again.

Enough furniture and decor to make the stay feel more of an exotic home.

It is very hard to find parking but I’ve stayed in la many times and air bnb’s in la and let me tell you that you shouldn’t expect to find parking anywhere.  The location is great, if you find parking you can pretty much leave the car and walk to all the convenient and cool (some really popular) places around. The neighborhood is overall friendly and easy to walk around during night time. I found a cockroach or two in the bathroom, but it’s not anything you shouldn’t expect bad for the price of the place and the fact that the people before you may tend to not know where to throw away the trash when they leave or forget their belongings behind. It’s hard to say anything bad, if you’re a decent person looking for a better than decent place to stay, this is it."

"317067",4438688,30028103,"2015-04-16",27841454,"Amy","This place has some good points and some bad points.  Unfortunately the bad points for us outweighed the good, but  it really depends on what type of person you are.  If you are open to daily spontaneous visits from the duplex owners and the renters in the front unit, and you don't mind some noise, then go for it.  

This unit is billed as having a ""private backyard"".  My husband and I tried to enjoy some peace in this private backyard many times, but the owner came over to water her garden DAILY which is located at your front door and in your ""private backyard"".  It's invasive.  Then, the owner's dad popped by to drop off a bike.  Also, every time the front unit tenants need to go to their car they pass by your front door and private backyard (this would not be a big deal if the other visits didn't occur).

If you don't mind noise, then again, this place could be your perfect spot.  When you are in bed and someone in the front unit takes a shower, be prepared to be awakened from a sound sleep because you hear the shower door slam and the water running as if it were right in your bedroom.  We turned up the air-purifier and solved the problem, but the first night was horrible because the tenants in the front unit were all showering at midnight.

To add insult to injury, the day we arrived, the unit was being treated for termites and also the following day..for hours!  They were under the house banging around and in the backyard.  It was maddening for people looking for a peaceful week!  Why didn't the owner wait and have this work done when the unit was empty? 

The owner was very, very nice and very helpful, so I feel a little bad saying this stuff.  But I do feel other renters should know what they are getting into because the listing isn't accurate.   

I must add, that my husband and I were not the typical guests.  We were not on vacation, out and about all day like many visitors will be, so we were particularly sensitive to the daily visits.  I think if you're going to charge $160-$200 a night, the very least the owner could do is water at a specific time each day. 

Pros: Nice neighborhood.  Quiet tree-lined street.  Close to Whole Foods and restaurants.  Unit is clean.  Nice size for 2 people.  Updated bathroom.  2 big TVs.

Cons:  Compromised privacy: daily visits from owners.  Private backyard, not completely private.  Incredibly soft bed, if that's your preference, you're in luck!  Cheap sheets.  Termite treatment on 2 days of my week long stay, not ideal."

The location is great with Abbot Kinney just a few blocks away. The parking in the neighborhood is free and there was plenty of room close by. Coffee, tea and a fridge were provided which was nice. Netflix and wifi are also provided. And the bikes… that was the best amenity! We parked the car and ended up riding bikes almost everywhere we went. We will be back for sure!"

Tons of amenities, tons of towels and bedding and everything you could need in the kitchen. Very high-end and modern. Amazing location. She was super responsive both before we arrived and throughout our trip. I can guarantee you’ll love this place if you stay there.  I have such a hard time making a choice when I search for Airbnb’s, and I looked for a long time, but when I found this one I knew it was right. Definitely worth the money. It was me, another adult, and 4 teenagers and there was ample room. Two bedrooms with queen beds, a loft with three single beds, and a comfortable pull out couch in the living room. Even though there aren’t a lot of square feet, the way it’s laid out feels spacious and I didn’t feel at all like we were on top of each other.   Their are high ceilings.  The air condition worked great, there was one in every room and it was super quiet.  We had a perfect Venice vacation, and staying at Jessica’s Airbnb was a huge factor. "

She very kindly let us leave our bags in her apartment on our last day after checkout. The apartment is small but in a great location. We walked to the beach and to Abbot Kinney (shops and restaurants) each day. We did feel a bit cramped, and I would probably choose a larger space for two people next time. There were also a few problems in the apartment, e.g. the toilet wouldn't flush (we had to reattach the chain), smell of gas from the stove, and the bathroom doorknob is loose. It's an older apartment, but the price might make it worthwhile. However, everything was clean, and we were comfortable overall. If you're traveling alone or don't mind a small space and you're ok with an older apartment, I would recommend this place."

We went to ask another young man a question after knocking on his 'bedroom' door. We, of course, didn't know this was his bedroom and thought it may have been a living area - after shouting hello a few times in the hallway it was our only option to knock the door where we heard the TV. He shouted at us and said we didn't have any manners for coming near his room.  We only wanted to ask if he we could head out for food (as we were not given a key). 
The bedroom was freezing - and I mean sooo cold. I am from Scotland so I'm used to cold weather, but I had to sleep with thermals, joggers, jumper and a hat on in bed. There wasn't even a duvet provided just a blanket. I was too scared to ask for another blanket after the first encounter with the young man.

Being so close to the house a main concern was privacy but me and my partner had no issues during our stay. There were children and a dog outside but it honestly did not negatively affect our stay in the slightest. Communication was swift and accessible; our hosts would check in with us through texts to see if we were okay. They even left me a gift for my anniversary. The location is great, with beaches, Universal Studios, Hollywood and movie studios a short drive away. I definitely recommend this spot for anyone wanting a lovely getaway in the valley."

Husets indretning var fin, men havde snydt os lidt, da vi havde forventet, at den ekstra seng stod i et separat værelse, hvilket den ikke gjorde, men stod faktisk i køkkenet (Bryggers), hvilket besværliggjorde, placering af tøj mv, for den 3 person. Er der tale om et barn, som kan sove alene, ser jeg dog intet problem, men for en selvstændig voksen, var det ikke optimalt.
Huset har en rigtig god beliggenhed, set i forhold til vores behov, det er ca. 30 minutter fra Downtown LA. Men da vores formål var at være i Glendale området hvor vores søn og svigerdatter bor var det perfekt.
Der er fin Wifi og TV, samt diverse muligheder for film med enten AppleTV eller Netfix. Fin lille have med lille bænk til en kold drink en varm aften :-)
Eneste negative, som jeg havde overset i beskrivelsen, var at det ikke var muligt, at benytte opvaskemaskinen og vaskemaskinen i huset. Vi havde rejst 6 dage inden ankomst, og havde en del tøj som vi gerne ville have vasket, samtidig havde vi planlagt, at lave mad og spise i huset.
Vi benyttede dog et vaskeri, ca 300meter fra huset, så OK, og med hensyn til opvask, så blev det gjort i hånden, og de store måltider blev spist ude.
Alt i Alt en god oplevelse i et rent og pænt hus, med en venlig husvært."

Through the Airbnb app and texting, the remaining finishing touches were completed and appliances were installed in a timely manner. The bed is comfortable and having a full kitchen is really nice because that seems to be lacking in most other studios in west/central LA. It is a good location because it is about equal distance from DTLA, Hollywood, and Santa Monica/Venice. The street it is located on isn't very walkable but I still felt safe 100% of the time living in the complex as a single female. The other renters/tenants were friendly."

Communication with the property manager was efficient and he was really helpful with whatever we requested for. 
It should be noted that as stated on the listing, guests are not allowed to bathe or do laundry after 11pm because the plumbing makes too much noise for the neighbours downstairs, so do take careful note of this!

It wouldn’t be appropriate if you want to be within walking distance of bars or cafes, it’s up in the hills so its quick to get to those areas in a car but would be rough on foot. The house itself is like a cabin, or bungalow, a small and simple studio with tons of windows and light. It feels a bit like glamping. And OMG the yard in this place is gorgeous.

Jeff is so personable and opens his home up so that you’re comfortable. The room is a loft above the garage and it is so cute and comfy! It was pretty cold out and it snowed so the room was pretty darn cold but there was a portable heater and a wood burning stove. I used the heater and it worked great. Kept the room nice and warm. The location was perfect if you’re going to Mt High. It’s also close to town. I would stay at his place again."

My husband and I found this place among many other great looking places in the area, but settled on this one as it had bikes for use and was known to be quiet.
Disappointed we were not! 
The place itself is super cozy and it was so nice having our own space. It was very quiet, which was nice as my husband is a light sleeper. The studio had everything we needed and more! The bed is comfortable, the kitchen and living area are spacious and there is everything you need to prepare your own food if you'd like (I will remember this for next time). There was also a great selection of movies. 
The use of the bikes was my favourite part. We ended up riding around everywhere, thus saving cab and rental car costs. And riding on the path beside the ocean through Santa Monica and Venice was breathtakingly beautiful.

It was small and so beautiful and boy did it fit everything we needed! The bed was divine, one of the comfiest bed I’ve ever slept on, the location was great. It was a place that there was an outdoor patio and a parking spot also. As this is a studio, there wasn’t much privacy between the sofa bed and actual bed just as we expected. Great spot!"

First check in wasn't that comfortable for me, I personally prefer meeting the host, getting information about the apartment, I didn't get to meet Lily, check in was NOT EASY. 
The black lock on the door, trying to understand where the key is at, etc. 
Second- The apartment is highly BRIGHT. 
All white! 
Thank God for eye mask, otherwise I'd breakup at crack of dawn. 
Lily was a kind host, she allowed me to check in early and stay an hour
Later. For that I am greatful. 
Air conditioning was also hard to figure out. 
I thought the house rules were WAY stricked. 
I'm not allowed to bring guests?? 
I can't sit with friends at my own apartment which I'm paying for ?? 
No noise after 8 PM?? It's Hollywood man. 
I don't and didn't intend to throw a party but seriously I feel like I'm walking on eggshell. 
Last but not least- I was not allowed to tell anyone that this is an Airbnb, but that I was Lilys guest. 
For all that and more - my stay was not as I expected. 
I rated good anyhow. 
Enjoy!"

The studio was clean, well-stocked, very private, and had a nice layout that really maximized the space. Ryan and Rachael provided everything one would need for a stay away from home, including a parking spot right in front of the house. They even made sure the pups were taken care of. When we arrived, there were two new dog toys on the counter, a water bowl with fresh water, and a dog bed with a cute blanket all laid out for them. We treat our dogs like they're our kids so we appreciate it when they're taken care of, as well.

Fred welcomed us to his home with a thoughtful gift basket and made us feel like a guest instead of a renter. The beds were very comfortable and the decor was very nice. It was enough space for our family of five. Fred had recently installed an air conditioning unit in one of the bedrooms and had fans in all of them. This helped as it was hot during our stay.
Now for the issues. #1 - the location did not make us feel safe. The first night we were there, we witnessed a fight at a local gas station. I jumped in my car and got out of there as fast as we could. The house is on a street with some places that are run down. #2 - there were many ants in the kitchen. We left some cookies out when we left for the day and they were covered in ants when we returned. We had to store all food in the fridge. #3 - the house has a very DIY feel about it. The two items most notable were the presence of extension cords and many power bars instead of permanent wiring and the shower head came up to the middle of my chest (I'm 6' tall).
All in all, we enjoyed our time and really liked Fred and his wife, but weren't able to relax."

Es wohnen auch noch andere da, da Suzan mehrere Zimmer vermietet. Dennoch ist alles sehr ruhig gewesen, als wir dort gewesen sind.

The building is new so it's amenities were also impressive - security, large pool area, gym, lobby/lounge, business services and secure parking structure - garage access from both Figueroa and Flower made the one-way streets in L.A. less challenging.  Location was also a key attraction - 1/2 block to LA Live and Staples Center.  Al was easily reachable for any questions I had.  He was allways quick to reply to any of my Text questions.

Tho Christina did give us great parking tips—If you’re going to use a car this neighborhood will be a real challenge, possibly a deciding factor, as it is v difficult to park at night. Other than that the neighborhood was an ideal location and is abundant Central American food—recommend Guatemalteca and Mar Azul for neighborhood food stops, as well as Tacos Juanita’s truck on 3rd and S Western."

Host gave us our privacy and was very kind.

There is a a good amount of space for three to four people to stay. Self check- in was super easy and convenient. It was also awesome that there was parking available right in front of the home. I really hate writing a poor review because my previous experiences with Airbnb have been so great,  but unfortunately it wasn’t the case here. The listing had specified that it had working AC. We got there on a hot weekend (90 degrees+) and the AC wasn’t working. Spoke to host to try and figure the situation out, but couldn’t be fixed over the phone. He offered to come by, but we were in town for an event so I was in and out and got back to the home late.
The AC not working really effected our ability to sleep and our comfort considering the house’s temperature was 81 degrees. There were also some cleanliness issue. I didn’t reach out the host about this because we were only staying the one day and at this point I felt like nothing else could be done. The bathtub/shower had a squishy mat on the floor that had hair particles and lint before we had used the shower. Upon opening the towels provided there was a ball of long hair that fell out. In the bedroom the comforter had dust on it and also had hair and lint. We needed to shake the comforters out in order to get this stuff off."

Points positifs : emplacement, vélos à disposition, cuisine.
Points négatifs : la propreté. Nous ne sommes pas trop exigeant sur ce point mais la c’est exagéré. Salle de bain commune (pas en photo, vous la partagez avec la chambre d’à côté qui peut donc venir dans la salle de bain même quand vous y êtes), vraiment sale (cheveux dans la baignoire ET sur les murs). Cuisine « dans son jus » il y a juste à voir le grille pain pour s’en rendre compte. Et le sol dans toute la maison de manière générale, si vous avez des chaussettes blanches, elles ne le seront plus en 10 minutes.
Ne comptez pas non plus sur le WiFi qui fonctionne quand il le souhaite et que c’est visiblement à vous de réparer puisque l’hôte ne nous a même répondu...
Et pour finir l’hôte, qui ne nous a même pas adressé un regard en passant près de nous dans la maison pendant ces 4 jours. Assez difficile à comprendre vu les commentaires sur la qualité d’accueil.

As I navigated up what looked like a private driveway, I ended up in front of this wonderful unit which is situated back behind a private entrance. The Airbnb unit is on the same grounds as the hosts dwelling. When you stop in front of the unit and look to your left, just past the flowering cacti and sweet smelling plants, there are jaw dropping views of the Hollywood sign, Capitol Records, DTLA, and numerous luxurious homes which seem to teeter on the sides of these lush green Hollywood Hills. Our host was there upon arrival and showed me the various codes that I would need to access doors and internet. It was a quick tour of the clean and nicely decorated unit. Anytime I needed assistance with a problem, the host was so responsive! Thanks Catherine for letting me feel like a superstar for my first visit to L.A. Everytime a Uber or Lyft dropped me off they were equally stunned by the views!! The beds were comfortable and the bathrooms clean.

Super quick and scenic ride up into the canyons, and the accommodation was exactly what we wanted. The farm is adorable, and the small little A-frame was surprisingly comfortable and nicely appointed - very impressed by the cute and modern bathroom. The upstairs loft was a beautiful and cozy place to wake up on the chilly summer morning with the view of the creek, breeze coming through the window, and the sounds of animals beginning to stir. Though the cabin is close-quarters to the main house we very much felt like we had our privacy in the very private back yard area. The house is close to the main road so there's a bit of the occasional car noise, but I was happy to take that in exchange for the close proximity to the market, coffee shop, and wine bar. I'd absolutely stay here again for a quick little getaway from the Hollywood bustle. "

We really had everything we needed and having the pool right outside our room was a huge bonus.  Morning coffee and a fridge full of complimentary drinks was great.  Ann had a fresh bottle of water by our bedside, bedsheets and towels were switched out during our week stay and we were free to use the entire home.  Our haven was their backyard...the pool, fruit trees, sweet dogs, tortoise and humming birds!  So peaceful.  Our 4 kids live in the area and we were so appreciative when they were welcome to join us at the pool.  We could just hang out and catch up...exactly what we were hoping for!

Location was also  key.  We walked to restaurants, coffee shops and yoga...just blocks away. 

A special thanks to Ann and (Website hidden by Airbnb) felt like we were staying with family.  Fun to talk to and so warm and inviting.  We look forward to staying with them again!"

Rebekah was not there but she was regularly in touch and her roommate Keilyn was super welcoming and helpful, she really made me feel at home. The room is big and comfortable and tastefully decorated (as is the rest of the house), and the other roommates are all very friendly and pleasant. I was a little worried about having to share the bathroom with several other people but that turned out not to be an issue at all, everybody was super clean and respectful. The area is nice with plenty of bars and restaurants at walking distance, and one can easily bike to the beach (there are bikes that you can borrow).

"62364",564102,415101960,"2019-02-21",3382665,"Kate","The location is fantastic, the bungalow is really cute and I always love mid-century decor! However, there were a few things that were not a match for me. They are all small things in the big picture, but they did make a difference. I was in LA for an on-camera interview, and the morning of my interview, the hot water stopped working after only five minutes. The house manual says ""there are complimentary soaps, shampoo, and conditioner"" but they were not present when I arrived; I went ahead and purchased those the night before the interview but when the hot water wasn't working, I was unable to shower as there was not enough time to figure out a fix.  The night before the interview, there was not an easy-to-find iron/ironing board and I had specifically looked for this amenity so that I wouldn't need to pack it; I could be misinterpreting but initially when I asked where I could find it I was just told that there wasn't one and it was sort of left at that, at first. I had to nudge a bit to get an iron/ironing board and the ironing board I was given literally had mud caked to the bottom of it. The bungalow is in an area underneath a flight pattern, so I was hearing planes from a small nearby airport until 10 or so at night. A few other reviewers mentioned having issues with the gates/entry codes and I also ran into that issue. The host was quickly responsive when I was locked out, though, which I appreciated. Last, there was a cleaning fee charge, but the instructions sent to me about check out asked for the guest to strip the bed and round up towels. Given the size, noise, lack of amenities like shampoo, and being charged the cleaning fee yet being asked to pick up things that a hotel wouldn't ask someone to clean up upon check out, for me, a hotel would be a better fit in this case. Wi-fi was fast and solid; the back yard is beautiful; the skylight creates a lovely natural light."

The location was superb as we were able to visit all of the sites we were planning to see.

The backyard had a play area for our daughter to crawl and roll around. The decor of the apartment gave off a very Chip and Joanna Gaines vibe so you know it was beautiful! 
Sam and Sara respected our privacy but were also available if we ever needed anything or had any questions.
The location was amazing - walking distance to a shopping center with a grocery store, coffee shop, drug store, etc. The neighborhood is also beautiful. 
We did have issues with the internet/tv as it would slow down or there will be no internet connection but since we were mainly out and about, it was no biggie plus we had our iPad for our little one to watch her favorites. All in all, our stay definitely exceeded our expectations and we are super content and grateful! Thank you again, Sam & Sara! "

Good location right on Hollywood boulevard. As described in writing and photo. Very much an appartment for visitors a bit lacking in homely touches. Good air conditioning, TV and Internet. Secure. Parking easy in attended lot across road. Bed fine and second single bed in dressing room behind revolving door although light switch outside...a bed side lamp would be good. Basic utensils and, cutlery and glasses. Would have benefited from and reasonable size sauce pan. Cupboards stripped bare ..some salt pepper na dmay be milk and coffee would have been great

Overall very dark..need better lights and more table lights/wall lights. 

Access only via rear of building..would have been noce to be able to go through front entrance (it has Key pad etc).

Mian issue is noise..made clear in (Website hidden by Airbnb) it is over night club so lots of bass coming through between (Phone number hidden by Airbnb) Ear plugs essential and do work to keep noise out..otherwi e very quiet with no traffic noise"

It was only a few blocks from the beach and also not far from shopping/restaurants. This was a beach vacation for me and my son (who was able to take surfing lessons!) and the house was quite roomy for just the two of us. Being New Yorkers, we're used to using Uber cars and walking (we prefer not to have a car, but certainly could have parked one near the house if we'd wanted). The bike/scooter path along the beach is delightful.  Our hosts left clear instructions about everything and were quick to respond  when needed (and I appreciated the morning coffee/Keurig supply!).

When we arrived we had minor hiccups when entering  but the neighbors were friendly and helped us out. Ben and his assistant were very quick to reply to any questions that we had as well. The room itself is exactly how it looks from the pictures. It’s small, comfy and overall a great place to stay to just come and sleep after a long day out.

The place is pretty dirty as far as the windows go. And the windows don’t have screens so you can’t really leave them open in this area.  Also the toilet has some issues. It clogged twice and even when functioning the plumbing is not great, neither is the shower pressure. The host was very willing to help which was nice.

The room and the bathroom were absolutely clean and the bed was really comfortable. Loulous place is really beautiful and definitely worth a stay! We would recommend it to everybody who wants to visit Venice!

It had gorgeous views, you don’t wanna leave the house because it’s so spectacular & comfortable. But if you do decide to leave its central to anywhere you’d ever want to go. The master bedroom is spacious and luxurious, the bathroom is breath taking. It felt like I was in Hawaii, showering with the beautiful greenery right outside their floor to ceiling windows. They have a really cool pool table that’s perfect for entertaining yourself or your friends. The kitchen is well stocked and has everything you’d need. The two extra bedrooms have very comfortable beds & beautiful views.

The place is really cute - small and compact but has everything you need for a short stay, including a very comfortable bed. Megan was so welcoming, kind and flexible with arrangements. She even shared a plate of food from her family dinner with me after my late arrival! Instructions to gain entry were extremely clear and I felt very safe in the accommodation. There is a fab welcome guide that they have put together inside the cabana - I particularly loved the tip to have breakfast on the boardwalk at Figtree's café. The cabana is in the most perfect location, situated so close to the beachfront as well as the gorgeous Abbot Kinney street for fashion and cafés. The lending of the bikes was an absolute bonus. I cycled all the way to Santa Monica and back to Venice Boardwalk and the sunset I saw that day made the brief LA experience a true highlight of my trip. Thanks again Megan!"

할리우드와 가깝고 외지지 않은 위치, 집 안에 무료주차 가능, 청결상태 깔끔, 기본 세면도구 수건 드라이기 등 구비, 편리한 체크인, 문의사항에 대한 호스트의 빠른 피드백

단점
화장실 하나뿐(세 팀이 머무름), 방 사이의 방음이 전혀 안됨 물론 여행에 지쳐 곯아 떨어졌지만 옆방 서양인 커플이 새벽까지 얘기하는 소리와 뜨거운 사랑을 나누는 소리가 너무 잘들려서 당황스러웠음

Walking in through the yard to a smell of trash from full trash bins, through smell of urine to a really worn down apartment with windows that don’t lock, windows looking out to a yard that is a complete mess and an eyes sore. No soap or hand towels, dirty pots and pans... Beware of the lack of photos. One ok thing was a comfortable mattress."

We had a blast ! We even stayed until 3am cause the DJ afterwards was awesome. I highly recommend this experience (beverage there is a bit more expensive than average I guess)"

Overall I give this place 5-stars for Cleanliness, Accuracy, Check-in, Communication and Value.

Jen & James' place has been everything I expected. Since my previous stay a couple of months back, Jen has added hand soap & a bath mat in the bathroom, which is an improvement.

I was not expecting the amount & level of noises, however. Yes, you will definitely hear the neighbors' rooster(s) as early as 4AM. I was not expecting the neighbors to be playing loud music throughout the day. If you need a place to rest or work in your room during the day, this place may not be suitable. The earplugs that Jen provided did help while sleeping.
I appreciated that very much and that Jen accommodated my needs.

As always & no matter the experience, I leave every place I stay at in the same condition as I found it, including making the bed nice & neat, picking up/cleaning up after myself, throwing my own trash in the outside bin & returning key(s) to its appropriate place.

Thank you very much Jen & James for hosting! It is obvious you have high standards of hygiene, cleanliness & tidiness. Keep up the fantastic work :)"

There is a lot of stuff standing around everywhere in the living room (especially lots of plants) and bathroom rules like ""Do not use this towel or we will have a serious issue"" did not make a guest feel welcomed either.

We loved that the place was it's own separate unit, but we still passed by the main house on the way in, so we had plenty of privacy, but still got to say hi to the hosts and get recommendations and such from them. Super friendly host.

It is located in downtown LA, walking distance from sky space, the last bookstore, lounges/ clubs, many places to eat, Walgreens, rite aid etc. it was easy to get around places using public transportation. We loved everything about the loft, it felt like home. Cindy left clear instructions on how to check in, important things about the loft and even provided us with suggestions on where to go/ eat. One thing I wasn’t to happy about was that the pool on the rooftop was locked, so we couldn’t enjoy the pool. But, there was an area on the rooftop where you could just sit back and chill.

The area is in walking proximity to the main Hollywood attractions such as Chinese Theater and Walk of Fame.  Also close to the metro/train and bus stops.  

Not as pleasant an area as I would have expected given it's Hollywood because of all the homelessness but that seemed to be a Hollywood/LA problem.  It's everywhere."

The room seems to be a modified room with thin walls. I could hear everything from the room next to mine and the living room which is also next to my bedroom that I was assigned. If I can hear things from outside, they could also hear everything too. Just a heads up if you need quiet space. The door lock work but can be easily opened if you force it. I didn't have any problems but if you like to have your rooms locked, then let the host know to fix it.

Bathroom is a lot smaller than expected. It also seems to be a modified bathroom to fit into the house. However, there is everything that you need, toilet, sink and shower. Shower is a little moldy but if you wear flip flops to take shower it should be fine. The shower has hot water. You will need to go through the kitchen to go to the bathroom. Basic toiletry (soap, shampoo, towel) is provided.

Kitchen also has out dated picture. They are not new as shown in the picture. It does have everything you need, microwave, stove and sink. Your designated refrigerator is located in the garage that is used as storage space. I only used microwave and brought my own plate to use and left it there for future guest. 

I never used living room area. 

Laundry room is in the garage/storage room. The washer and dryer works as expected.

Parking can be hazardous. Ask the host where is the safe area to park! There is a spot in front of the house that you can get an accident if you park overnight (a hit and run). The street can become very busy around school time (7:30am and 2:30 pm) without any parking around. The house is literally right in front of a school. 

I have never met Brian during my stay (over a month). I only met an old couple living in the house. They do not speak english, only Chinese. You will need to communicate with (Hidden by Airbnb) translator. If you need anything urgently the couple will call Brian on the phone so he can speak to you."

As stated in the description, every guest is supposed to feel like they're home. And there's nothing more to add to that. As a guest at Judith's place you certainly do feel like you've never lived anywhere else. She'll make you feel like home from the first moment you enter her place. Simply a wonderful family that I'd recommend everyone to meet. "

Very thoughtful touches throughout the very welcoming space, Stunning backyard  with plentiful and very yummy Fruit trees.
 Plenty of private outdoor seating to enjoy the birds and butterflies in your own private Tropical oasis in the heart of historic Pasadena. 

 It's really very nice,  tastefully decorated,  Fully stocked kitchen and bathroom.  Comfy beds, spotless, ultra clean, Super Fast internet, workspace area.  Ready to go- move in.  All thats needed is yourself and an overnight bag. Everything else is taken care of. 

Centrally Located,   Easy freeway access yet, in a quiet very family oriented neighborhood.  
 Exactly as pictured, a great deal for this central highly sought after area. 

 World class attractions all close by, including grocery shopping and restaurants minutes away- easily walkable.

Had a great time and very much enjoyed Ginger's home. Would have loved to stay longer to really enjoy this guest house. 

  Super positive experience with the host. Ginger made my last minute travel plans very easy.  Lovely couple,  Warm and welcoming, going above and beyond, making sure I was taken care of. 
 Highly recommend this home and honored to stay again 
  Thanks for sharing your little part of LA with me. I  look forward to visiting again.

We were blown away once we actually got there! The house was so quaint, comfortable,  quiet and very nicely appointed and was even better in person. Not to mention it was literally 50 yards from Venice beach! It's on a quiet, safe beach street with lots of character in a cool community within walking distance to lot of great food, drink and fun. There was also 5 bikes for us to use and lots of beach gear that we took full advantage of. We totally enjoyed our stay and would definitely book it again!"

The room was very minimal (I was actually moved to a different room, which was downstairs- so I had to walk outside to go upstairs in order to access the bathroom, which was a little inconvenient) but the bed was comfortable. That said, they were very flexible with check and check out, very responsive, and very nice hosts! I really appreciated that.

The bathroom situation was disgusting. So disgusting that I didn't even use the toilet. The room is outdated and cold (bed matters is of heated type, but I wasn't told about that until I asked). The 3 room rental rooms are so close to each other that if you're unlucky and someone snores at next door, you can hear it loud and clear the whole night. They have also made the backyard like a garage, which I think they rent the spots and that causes so much noise and smoke early in the mornings when people start their cars."

Very clean

Walls are paper thin to other section of home. 

The backyard is creepy at night.

The bathroom has a window that faces the backyard that is not covered and you can see clearly into this window from the street and other homes at any time of day. Not top of the the shower curtain is clear. 

There is a huge glass door that goes across the whole back of the kitchen that also does not have a curtain.

The heater is very small I would recommend bringing extra blankets and pillows.

When I was there the gas and hot water went out after the first night, and it was very inconvenient."

His apartment was neat and tidy and had a nice view. It was conveniently located. The beds were big enough for 2 people to sleep on them comfortably on each of them. 

The climb to his apartment is a challenge if you do not have a car with good ground clearance. I think that is the only thing that I wish I knew before hand.

The location was great (only about a 15 minute walk to the 2nd Street area with all the shops and restaurants) and the neighbors were very friendly.

The area of the neighborhood is a little rough, but it is close to various tourists spots. The house is more like a motel. There were around 12 rooms being rented out, which was a little deceitful. Our room was extremely clean. Sharing a bathroom with multiple people made for the bathroom to not be as clean. You get what you pay for, so I can't complain. It was a great deal to stay here for as long as we did. "

The neighborhood was OK I definitely wouldn’t leave anything of value in your car, but then again I'm not from LA.
Our room was pretty small, so the only negative feedback I would have would be the cost, I felt like if the room had been $20-25 less per night it would have been fantastic. We paid $111.00 dollars for a Saturday night for two people.  I would definitely suggest this location and hosts to anyone planning on visiting the Van Nuys area of LA.

At night it was a bit noisy, though with the shrubs and locked gate it felt secluded and safe.  It's an older house with thin walls/doors, so conversations in the main area carry over into the adjoining bedrooms and vice versa.
There are two shared bathrooms, rather than a typical master bed/bath setup.  The main bathroom showerhead was dripping rather noisily when we arrived; this was fixed on the third day.  The other issue was cleanliness, the floors were rather unclean on arrival (walking on the floor barefoot led to blackened soles); on our request, they sent the cleaning lady over again and she re-cleaned this on our second day.  
The coffee machine was a nice touch.  Appliances/kitchen area was notably well-stocked and the kitchen was very clean- it would be a good place to do a group dinner.  Also, the house has a Nest thermostat and the AC was powerful.  For a hot weekend in LA, we were very thankful.
The host was very friendly, reasonably attentive, and would typically get back within a few hours."

Wat ons heel erg tegenviel is dat alles wat viezig was. De inrichting is leuk, maar rook muf en was wat vergaan.
De lakens en handdoeken hadden vlekken (bruine, zwart en rood?) leek wel of ze niet gewassen waren. Het zitje dat buitenstaat zat vol met aangekoekte etensresten. Het douchegordijn was ook heel hard aan vernieuwing toe. Kortom de ruimte en spullen mogen wel een opknapbeurt gebruiken en beter gewassen worden."

It is the best home rental experience we have had to date and it completely exceeded our expectations.  Our fantastic experience started before we arrived - when we received a goole doc full of information about the house and recommendations for local restaurants, beaches, and other activities.  When we arrived, the house was immaculate and just as pictured on the website.  We also really appreciated the thoughtful welcome note with muffins and fruit.  The house was well stocked with everything we could have needed or wanted.  Curt and Denise were very generous about sharing what they had in their home.  We loved using the bikes, beach chairs and kayaks!  The bikes were a perfect way to get to and from the Grand Prix (the reason for our visit).  In addition to the house itself, we loved the neighborhood.  We enjoyed walking and biking to the beach, downtown Long Beach, and the bay.  We also spent a good bit of time on 2nd Street, which is right around the corner.    We enjoyed our time here very much and hope to come back again in the future!"

CONS: Can be tight for 2 people. The space isn’t quite as “cute” and deliberate as the pictures suggest. It’s clean, so that helps. Sometimes, the steamer will trip the breaker switch. And random, but I thought the space could use a small sofa. Also, first impression is weird. Try to ignore the carpet and decor of the building hallways. That look doesn’t carry through to the room."

The one ""not as advertised"" feature is that the place is actually fairly dark, even cave-like, rather than the bright space portrayed in the promotional photos. This isn't all bad; it was refreshing to come in after bright LA afternoons and have a cool dark space to unwind, and during the daytime the light is sufficient to allow for most activities. 

At night it's a different story: the bulbs in the living area and bedroom are all (extremely) low-wattage, and these rooms are to the point that it's not possible to read a book on the couch with all the available lights on. I understand the importance of energy conservation, but a single high-wattage lamp to allow for reading and other light-requiring activities would have been very welcome. (If I simply failed to find a dimmer switch, then this is my mistake, but I did look.)"

 - Awesome view : most buildings in LA are on the first floor. Here you'll be on the third, which will give you an awesome view over the city.
 - Really, really clean place
 - All the equipment is brand new: kitchen ware, bathroom, TV
 - Great volumes (the ceiling is quite high)
 - So many windows!
 - The location is really great, and Michelle will provide you with a parking permit with the which you'll be able to park the car right at the front of the building.
 - It's right by a metro stop! You can go to Santa Monica in 15 minutes, and to so many other places without driving a car

Overall, probably the best place i've ever been to!"

The location is good for touristy things although I think there are much better locations that are only fractionally more.  Many of the light bulbs were working and the pillows are uncomfortable (I ended up bringing my own).  These aren't really big deals.  My biggest issue is that the building itself (not the inside of the apartment, but outside) is gross.  It's fairly dirty.  We also found it very loud - one of the bedrooms has a window that's the hallway of the building so any time anybody comes and goes you'll be able to hear it.  The wall are also very thin. 

I was here because I got some work done on my apartment and needed a place for a week, but if I were on vacation, I wouldn't stay here personally."

The photos of the unit are accurate and the communication with the host was great, just some things about the unit itself could’ve been better. My girlfriend and I had an OK stay. 
Cons:
-  the toilet kept running water for our whole stay, so you will definitely hear the toilet when you are trying to sleep. It works, just the noise is really annoying. We were told the hosts can fix the problem but we would have to stay at the unit too while the toilet is getting fixed because there’s no extra key. Also We were given 1 toilet paper roll... I mentioned this to the host and she kindly delivered more rolls for our use. 


- there was a random sock stuck in the couch,which was pretty gross and showed that the unit wasn’t cleaned well enough prior to my arrival. 

- I was planning to use their washer and dryer in the middle of our stay, so I had purchased laundry detergent (no soap of any kind was available- hand soap for bathroom, shampoo for shower, detergent for washer). As I was going to load my clothes in the washer, I’ve noticed the washer was already loaded with old towels sitting in water and not taken care of. I was extremely disappointed in this, for I needed to wash my clothes and I wasn’t about to do someone else’s laundry. Gross. 


Like I’ve mentioned above, I’ve stayed at Orsini before and had a much more pleasant experience. I decided to book another unit in Orsini but was disappointed in my stay. The hosts are nice and attentive, but I would definitely not be back here and I encourage others to find a better place."

Some of our plans were delayed, and if it wasnt for Joe's (& Ashley's) flexibility, we wouldn't have been able to do anything on the final day of our stay.  Seriously, we were able to do five hours worth of activities ONLY because of them allowing us to checkout late!

My wife really liked the soap, shampoo, conditioner, but i wont mention that in this review O_o"

This home is absolutely gorgeous, it was very accommodating to every need any person could possibly have, views from the multiple balconies in this home were scenic (one view you could even see the Hollywood sign), very quiet and nice neighborhood, and everything about it I completely loved. You don't have to worry about parking outside or on the street due to the gated parking garage that designates 2 specific parking spaces for you and a guest. If you come across this home and it's NOT booked, definitely book it while you still can because it is definitely worth it."

So convenient and central, but still quite quiet and residential. The parking space in the back is very large and safe (I've had issues with street parking in both LA & SF).  Easy checkin/checkout and owners provided all necessities (toiletries, kitchenware, etc)"

The location is great---a short walk to Whole Foods, the 99cent store and many fun restaurants. It is also very close to Lincoln Blvd, with easy access to public transportation to all of LA  as well as bus to the airport if you choose not to drive.
The bedroom was basic but had all I needed, especially a comfortable bed that was larger than the photo indicated....a nice surprise. I really enjoyed being able to take a bath after too much travel, with plenty of hot water...The kitchen was well-appointed if one wished to prepare meals. Todd was very kind and patient with all the changes and delays in both my arrival and departure times which was greatly appreciated. It was good value for the area and I would recommend his home. Thanks, Todd!"

During the day, there are amazing windows and the LA sunshine pours through. When it's dark, Pauline has done a great job adding different kinds of lighting so that the room always feels cozy. This is a very thoughtful, comfortable place - large bed, great pillows. The location is fantastic, right by many of the shops and restaurants in Echo Park. Pauline is very each to reach and check-in and check-out were super easy. Would highly recommend."
